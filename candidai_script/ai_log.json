now ready for production with new aspect ratios\\n\\n* Facebook\\n* Twitter\\n* LinkedIn\\n* Mail\\n\\nOur state-of-the-art image generation and editing model which has captured the imagination of the world, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image 🍌, is now generally available, ready for production environments, and comes with new features like a wider range of aspect ratios in addition to being able to specify image-only output.\\n\\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image empowers users to seamlessly blend multiple images, maintain consistent characters for richer storytelling, perform targeted edits with natural language, and leverage Gemini\\'s extensive world knowledge for image generation and modification. The model is accessible through theGemini APIonGoogle AI Studioand onVertex AIfor enterprise use.\\n\\nFurther expanding creative possibilities, the model now supports 10 different aspect ratios. This allows for effortless content creation across various formats, from cinematic landscapes to vertical social media posts.\\n\\nSupported ratios include:\\n\\n* Landscape: 21:9, 16:9, 4:3, 3:2\\n* Square: 1:1\\n* Portrait: 9:16, 3:4, 2:3\\n* Flexible: 5:4, 4:5\\n\\n## What people are building\\n\\nCartwheelis harnessing AI to move beyond the \"slot machine user experience\" of many image generators, giving artists direct control to bring their creative vision to life. After months of building their \"Pose Mode\" feature and finding that other models failed to deliver, the team found a solution in the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. By combining Cartwheel\\'s 3D posing tool with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, they have created a powerful new image creation system that delivers unparalleled character control and consistency.\\n\\n“Other models couldn\\'t render characters from arbitrary camera angles or maintain faithfulness to a pose without sacrificing \"world knowledge\". The new Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model was the first that could provide both.” -Andrew Carr, Co-founder of Cartwheel\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nVolley, the creators of the AI powered dungeon crawler Wit\\'s End, use Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to generate and edit visuals in-session—character portraits, dynamic scene stills, multi-character compositions, and quick iterative edits from chat or voice.\\n\\n“The model demonstrates state-of-the-art rule-following to aesthetic guidance while retaining latency under <10s, unlocking many live applications, for example, letting players select styles and refine outputs in multi-turn loops.” - James Wilsterman, CTO at Volley\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nIt\\'s been incredible to see the community\\'s creativity in action during recent hackathons withKaggleandCerebral Valley, which saw hundreds of submissions showcasing the model\\'s capabilities in diverse fields like STEM education, marketing collateral, and real-time augmented reality.\\n\\n## Start building\\n\\nDevelopers can begin building with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image today. Check out thedeveloper docsandcookbookfor guidance on the new features, including the expanded aspect ratios and the ability to specify image-only output. The model is available via theGemini APIand for testing inGoogle AI Studio.\\n\\nBuilding with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is easy with Google AI Studio’s “build mode.” Instantly create and remix custom AI-powered apps from a single prompt, like \"Build me an image editing app with filters.\" When you\\'re ready, deploy your creation directly from AI Studio or save the code to GitHub—all for free. Try out and remix some of our example apps:\\n\\n* Bananimate: Create animated GIFs with Nano Banana from your images and prompts.\\n* Enhance: Infinitely zoom into any photography with our creative upscaler. See if you can find the easter-egg (hint: 🍌)\\n* Fit check: Upload a photo of yourself and an outfit to see how it looks on you. A virtual fitting room powered by Nano Banana.\\n\\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image is priced at $0.039 per image, with a rate of $30.00 per 1 million output tokens. Pricing for other input and output modalities aligns with the standard Gemini 2.5 Flashpricing.\\n\\nHere is a sample code to get you started:\\n\\n```\\nfromgoogleimportgenaifromgoogle.genaiimporttypesfromPILimportImage\\n\\nclient=genai.Client()prompt=\"Create a photograph of the subject in this image as if they were living in the 1980s.

This is the first Gemini Robotics model to be made broadly available. It acts as a high-level reasoning model for a robot.\\n\\nThis model specializes in capabilities critical for robotics, including visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. It can also natively call tools, likeGoogle Searchto find information, and can call a vision-language-action model (VLA) or any other third-party user-defined functions to execute the task.\\n\\nYou can get started building with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 today in preview viaGoogle AI Studioand the Gemini API.\\n\\nThis model is designed for tasks that are notoriously challenging for robots. Imagine asking a robot, “Can you sort these objects into the correct compost, recycling and trash bins?\" To complete this task, the robot needs to look up the local recycling guidelines on the internet, understand the objects in front of it and figure out how to sort them based on local rules, then do all the steps to complete putting them away. Most daily tasks, like this one, take contextual information and multiple steps to complete.\\n\\nGemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is the first thinking model optimized for this kind of embodied reasoning.

now ready for production with new aspect ratios\\n\\n* Facebook\\n* Twitter\\n* LinkedIn\\n* Mail\\n\\nOur state-of-the-art image generation and editing model which has captured the imagination of the world, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image 🍌, is now generally available, ready for production environments, and comes with new features like a wider range of aspect ratios in addition to being able to specify image-only output.\\n\\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image empowers users to seamlessly blend multiple images, maintain consistent characters for richer storytelling, perform targeted edits with natural language, and leverage Gemini\\'s extensive world knowledge for image generation and modification. The model is accessible through theGemini APIonGoogle AI Studioand onVertex AIfor enterprise use.\\n\\nFurther expanding creative possibilities, the model now supports 10 different aspect ratios. This allows for effortless content creation across various formats, from cinematic landscapes to vertical social media posts.\\n\\nSupported ratios include:\\n\\n* Landscape: 21:9, 16:9, 4:3, 3:2\\n* Square: 1:1\\n* Portrait: 9:16, 3:4, 2:3\\n* Flexible: 5:4, 4:5\\n\\n## What people are building\\n\\nCartwheelis harnessing AI to move beyond the \"slot machine user experience\" of many image generators, giving artists direct control to bring their creative vision to life. After months of building their \"Pose Mode\" feature and finding that other models failed to deliver, the team found a solution in the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. By combining Cartwheel\\'s 3D posing tool with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, they have created a powerful new image creation system that delivers unparalleled character control and consistency.\\n\\n“Other models couldn\\'t render characters from arbitrary camera angles or maintain faithfulness to a pose without sacrificing \"world knowledge\". The new Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model was the first that could provide both.” -Andrew Carr, Co-founder of Cartwheel\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nVolley, the creators of the AI powered dungeon crawler Wit\\'s End, use Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to generate and edit visuals in-session—character portraits, dynamic scene stills, multi-character compositions, and quick iterative edits from chat or voice.\\n\\n“The model demonstrates state-of-the-art rule-following to aesthetic guidance while retaining latency under <10s, unlocking many live applications, for example, letting players select styles and refine outputs in multi-turn loops.” - James Wilsterman, CTO at Volley\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nIt\\'s been incredible to see the community\\'s creativity in action during recent hackathons withKaggleandCerebral Valley, which saw hundreds of submissions showcasing the model\\'s capabilities in diverse fields like STEM education, marketing collateral, and real-time augmented reality.\\n\\n## Start building\\n\\nDevelopers can begin building with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image today. Check out thedeveloper docsandcookbookfor guidance on the new features, including the expanded aspect ratios and the ability to specify image-only output. The model is available via theGemini APIand for testing inGoogle AI Studio.\\n\\nBuilding with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is easy with Google AI Studio’s “build mode.” Instantly create and remix custom AI-powered apps from a single prompt, like \"Build me an image editing app with filters.\" When you\\'re ready, deploy your creation directly from AI Studio or save the code to GitHub—all for free. Try out and remix some of our example apps:\\n\\n* Bananimate: Create animated GIFs with Nano Banana from your images and prompts.\\n* Enhance: Infinitely zoom into any photography with our creative upscaler. See if you can find the easter-egg (hint: 🍌)\\n* Fit check: Upload a photo of yourself and an outfit to see how it looks on you. A virtual fitting room powered by Nano Banana.\\n\\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image is priced at $0.039 per image, with a rate of $30.00 per 1 million output tokens. Pricing for other input and output modalities aligns with the standard Gemini 2.5 Flashpricing.\\n\\nHere is a sample code to get you started:\\n\\n```\\nfromgoogleimportgenaifromgoogle.genaiimporttypesfromPILimportImage\\n\\nclient=genai.Client()prompt=\"Create a photograph of the subject in this image as if they were living in the 1980s.

This is the first Gemini Robotics model to be made broadly available. It acts as a high-level reasoning model for a robot.\\n\\nThis model specializes in capabilities critical for robotics, including visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. It can also natively call tools, likeGoogle Searchto find information, and can call a vision-language-action model (VLA) or any other third-party user-defined functions to execute the task.\\n\\nYou can get started building with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 today in preview viaGoogle AI Studioand the Gemini API.\\n\\nThis model is designed for tasks that are notoriously challenging for robots. Imagine asking a robot, “Can you sort these objects into the correct compost, recycling and trash bins?\" To complete this task, the robot needs to look up the local recycling guidelines on the internet, understand the objects in front of it and figure out how to sort them based on local rules, then do all the steps to complete putting them away. Most daily tasks, like this one, take contextual information and multiple steps to complete.\\n\\nGemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is the first thinking model optimized for this kind of embodied reasoning.

      "Subject: Bridging Game Design & AI Innovation at Google – Let’s Connect  \n\nHi Lauren,  \n\nAs a fellow advocate for blending creativity and technology (your work in game theory and design aligns with my passion for video game development), I wanted to reach out regarding opportunities at Google. Your expertise in talent strategy for tech teams—paired with Google’s breakthroughs like Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 and Veo 3’s 9:16 video capabilities—resonates deeply with my work at Dotdotdot, where I’ve engineered React.js-powered web apps and led UI/UX design for immersive digital experiences.  \n\nI’ve been inspired by Google’s push to enhance creative tools like Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, particularly how Cartwheel leverages it for character consistency—a challenge I’ve tackled firsthand in 3D modeling and game design projects. With expertise in full-stack development (Python, JavaScript) and a focus on user-centric design, I’m eager to contribute to initiatives that empower creators through cutting-edge AI.  \n\nGiven your background in fostering tech talent across Europe (I’m based in Milan, completing my Computer Engineering degree at Politecnico Di Milano), I’d love to discuss how my hybrid technical and creative skill set could align with Google’s innovation roadmap. Would you be open to a brief virtual coffee chat this week?  \n\nBest regards,  \nAlessio Antonucci",
      "Subject: Bridging European Tech Talent & Google’s Creative AI Vision  \n\nHi Lauren,  \n\nAs a Computer Engineering student at Politecnico di Milano with hands-on software development experience at Dotdotdot (Milan’s award-winning design/tech studio), I’ve been closely following Google’s breakthroughs in creative AI tools like Gemini 2.5 Flash Image – particularly how teams are applying its aspect ratio flexibility and character consistency to redefine interactive storytelling.  \n\nYour unique background bridging mathematics, organizational psychology, and technical talent development at Google/Adobe caught my attention. With my combined foundation in full-stack development (React, Python, C#) and human-centered design projects (including interactive installations and game prototypes), I believe I could contribute meaningfully to teams shaping tools that democratize creative expression – especially given Google’s expanded focus on multimodal AI applications as highlighted in recent developer blog updates.  \n\nWould you have 15 minutes to discuss how emerging European tech talent might align with Google’s innovation pipeline in London or Milan? I’m particularly curious about how you see cross-functional teams balancing rapid AI advancements with thoughtful UX – a challenge I navigated firsthand while optimizing AR interfaces for accessibility at Dotdotdot.  \n\nLooking forward to your insights,  \nAlessio Antonucci  \nPolitecnico di Milano ‘26 | Software Developer  \nLinkedIn: [Your LinkedIn] | Portfolio: [Your Portfolio URL]",
      "Subject: Combining Tech Innovation & Human-Centric Design at Google  \n\nHi Lauren,  \n\nAs someone who bridges technical expertise with talent strategy at Google, I wanted to connect after seeing your work adapting HR practices for complex technical teams across Europe.

image-only output.\\n\\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image empowers users to seamlessly blend multiple images, maintain consistent characters for richer storytelling, perform targeted edits with natural language, and leverage Gemini\\'s extensive world knowledge for image generation and modification. The model is accessible through theGemini APIonGoogle AI Studioand onVertex AIfor enterprise use.\\n\\nFurther expanding creative possibilities, the model now supports 10 different aspect ratios. This allows for effortless content creation across various formats, from cinematic landscapes to vertical social media posts.\\n\\nSupported ratios include:\\n\\n* Landscape: 21:9, 16:9, 4:3, 3:2\\n* Square: 1:1\\n* Portrait: 9:16, 3:4, 2:3\\n* Flexible: 5:4, 4:5\\n\\n## What people are building\\n\\nCartwheelis harnessing AI to move beyond the \"slot machine user experience\" of many image generators, giving artists direct control to bring their creative vision to life. After months of building their \"Pose Mode\" feature and finding that other models failed to deliver, the team found a solution in the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. By combining Cartwheel\\'s 3D posing tool with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, they have created a powerful new image creation system that delivers unparalleled character control and consistency.\\n\\n“Other models couldn\\'t render characters from arbitrary camera angles or maintain faithfulness to a pose without sacrificing \"world knowledge\". The new Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model was the first that could provide both.” -Andrew Carr, Co-founder of Cartwheel\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nVolley, the creators of the AI powered dungeon crawler Wit\\'s End, use Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to generate and edit visuals in-session—character portraits, dynamic scene stills, multi-character compositions, and quick iterative edits from chat or voice.\\n\\n“The model demonstrates state-of-the-art rule-following to aesthetic guidance while retaining latency under <10s, unlocking many live applications, for example, letting players select styles and refine outputs in multi-turn loops.” - James Wilsterman, CTO at Volley\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nIt\\'s been incredible to see the community\\'s creativity in action during recent hackathons withKaggleandCerebral Valley, which saw hundreds of submissions showcasing the model\\'s capabilities in diverse fields like STEM education, marketing collateral, and real-time augmented reality.\\n\\n## Start building\\n\\nDevelopers can begin building with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image today.

This is the first Gemini Robotics model to be made broadly available. It acts as a high-level reasoning model for a robot.\\n\\nThis model specializes in capabilities critical for robotics, including visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. It can also natively call tools, likeGoogle Searchto find information, and can call a vision-language-action model (VLA) or any other third-party user-defined functions to execute the task.\\n\\nYou can get started building with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 today in preview viaGoogle AI Studioand the Gemini API.\\n\\nThis model is designed for tasks that are notoriously challenging for robots. Imagine asking a robot, “Can you sort these objects into the correct compost, recycling and trash bins?\" To complete this task, the robot needs to look up the local recycling guidelines on the internet, understand the objects in front of it and figure out how to sort them based on local rules, then do all the steps to complete putting them away. Most daily tasks, like this one, take contextual information and multiple steps to complete.\\n\\nGemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is the first thinking model optimized for this kind of embodied reasoning.

This is the first Gemini Robotics model to be made broadly available. It acts as a high-level reasoning model for a robot.\\n\\nThis model specializes in capabilities critical for robotics, including visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. It can also natively call tools, likeGoogle Searchto find information, and can call a vision-language-action model (VLA) or any other third-party user-defined functions to execute the task.\\n\\nYou can get started building with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 today in preview viaGoogle AI Studioand the Gemini API.\\n\\nThis model is designed for tasks that are notoriously challenging for robots. Imagine asking a robot, “Can you sort these objects into the correct compost, recycling and trash bins?\" To complete this task, the robot needs to look up the local recycling guidelines on the internet, understand the objects in front of it and figure out how to sort them based on local rules, then do all the steps to complete putting them away. Most daily tasks, like this one, take contextual information and multiple steps to complete.\\n\\nGemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is the first thinking model optimized for this kind of embodied reasoning. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on both academic and internal benchmarks, inspired by real-world use cases from our trusted tester program.', 'title': 'Building the Next Generation of Physical Agents with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5- Google Developers Blog', 'url': 'https://developers.googleblog.com/en/building-the-next-generation-of-physical-agents-with-gemini-robotics-er-15/'}, {'markdown': 'developers.googleblog.com uses cookies from Google to deliver and enhance the quality of its services and to analyze traffic.Learn more.\\n\\n# Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast – new pricing, new configurations and better resolution\\n\\n* Facebook\\n* Twitter\\n* LinkedIn\\n* Mail\\n\\nToday, we’re launching three big Veo updates: support for vertical format outputs (9:16 aspect ratio), 1080p HD output, andnew, lower pricing.We\\'re also makingVeo 3and Veo 3 Fast stable and ready for scaled production use in the Gemini API.\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\n## More Veo, for less\\n\\nEffective today, we’re making it more affordable to generate high-quality videos with Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast with price reductions across the board.\\n\\n* Veo 3:Now $0.40 / second; was $0.75 / second\\n\\n* Veo 3 Fast:Now $0.15 / second; was $0.40 / second\\n\\n## Vertical video and 1080p support\\n\\nWith Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast, you can now set the aspect ratio to 9:16 so that you can generate vertical format videos that are perfect for mobile-first and social use cases.

(OR CREATE IT)**: Analyze the recruiter's background deeply to identify shared elements.\n   - Primary targets: Same university, previous companies, mutual connections, shared professional groups.\n   - **Fallback strategy**: If no direct common ground exists, identify a specific, non-generic aspect of their career you genuinely admire (e.g., an article they wrote, a talk they gave, their transition from one industry to another).\n\n2. **LEAD WITH A STRATEGIC SUBJECT LINE**: Create a subject line that is both professional and intriguing, ideally hinting at the common ground or a key value proposition. *Example: \"Fellow [University Name] Alum & Data Scientist\" or \"Question about your work at [Previous Company]\"*.\n\n3. **LEAD WITH CONNECTION**: Start the email's first sentence by mentioning the most compelling commonality naturally. Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment. **If the SCENARIO is \"Specific Role\", subtly mention your interest in that area.**\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

Generative recommenders (GRs) represent a new paradigm in the field of recommendation systems (e.g.HSTU,OneRec). These models draw inspiration from recent advancements in transformer architectures used for language and vision tasks. They approach the recommendation problem, including both ranking and retrieval, as a sequential transduction task. This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens. The reward model uses an open-sourced HSTU architecture in the convenience of reproducing this study. We adopt the standard RLHF approach of training a reward model using offline, human-collected feedback. We start by creating a proxy reward, scored on a scale from 1 to 5 in the convenience of understanding. This reward model is co-trained as a shallow reward head on top of the generative recommender. It predicts the reward for the most recently selected title based on a user’s interaction history. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare the model’s performance against two simple baselines: (1) predicting the next reward as the average reward the user has given in their past interactions, and (2) predicting it as the average reward that all users have assigned to that particular title in previous interactions.\\n\\nTable 1: Reward model performance metrics\\n\\nWe observe that the model’s predictions do not significantly outperform the simple baselines. This result is intuitive, as a user’s historical interactions typically cover only a small subset of titles, making it difficult to accurately predict their responses to the vast number of unexplored titles in the catalogue. We expect this to be a potential issue for any large recommendation systems where the ratio between explored and unexplored titles is very small.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\n3. Lack of Logged Policy\\n\\nIn recommendation systems, the policy that generated the logged data is typically unknown and cannot be directly estimated. Offline reinforcement learning methods often rely on Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to debias such data by reweighting interactions according to the logging policy’s action probabilities. However, estimating the logging policy accurately is challenging and prone to error, which can introduce additional biases, and IPS itself is known to suffer from high variance. Consequently, offline RL approaches that depend on IPS are ill-suited for our setting.\\n\\n## Advantage Weighted Supervised Fine Tuning\\n\\nGiven the three challenges outlined above, we propose a new algorithm Advantage-Weighted SFT (A-SFT). It leverages a combination of supervised fine-tuning and advantage reweighting from reinforcement learning. The key observation is as follows. Despite the reward estimation for each individual event having a high uncertainty, we find the estimations of rewards contain directional signals between high-reward and low-reward events. These signals could help better align the model during post-training.\\n\\nA central factor in this study is the generalization ability of the reward model. Better generalization enables more accurate predictions of user preferences for unseen titles, thereby making exploration more effective. For reward models with moderate to high generalization power, both online RL methods such as PPO and offline RL methods such as CQL can perform effectively. However, in our setting, reward model generalization is worse than the language counterparts’, which makes these algorithms less appropriate. In addition, the use of techniques like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) introduces a heightened risk of high-variance estimates, prompting us to exclude algorithms such as off-policy REINFORCE.\\n\\nOur proposed method A-SFT does not rely on IPS. With no need of prior knowledge of the logging policy, it can be generally applied to cases where observation of the environments are limited or biased. This is particularly useful to the recommendation setting due to the user feedback loop and distribution shifts with time. Without knowing the logging policy, A-SFT still provides means to control the policy deviation between the current policy and logging policy by tuning the parameter. This design provides essential means to control the learnt bias from uncertain reward models. We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1. Rejection Sampling Direct Preference Optimization / Identity Preference Optimization (RS DPO/IPO): this is a variant of DPO/IPO where, for each user history x, \\u200bwe generate contrasting response pairs by training an ensemble of reward models to estimate confidence intervals for the reward of multiple potential responses y. If the lower bound of the reward confidence interval for one response\\u200b is less than the upper bound for another response, then this pair is used to train DPO/IPO.\\n1. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL): This is a standard offline algorithm that learns a conservative Q function, penalizing overestimation of Q-values, particularly in regions of the state-action space with little or no reward data.\\n1. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): This is a standard RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) algorithm that uses reward models as an online environment. PPO learns an advantage function and optimizes the policy to maximize expected reward while maintaining proximity to the initial policy.\\n\\nWe sampled a separate test set of O(Millions) users. This test set is collected on a future date after the training.\\n\\n## Offline Evaluation Results\\n\\nWe evaluate our algorithm on a dataset of high-reward user trajectories. For sake of simplicity, we consider a trajectory to have a high reward if the accumulated reward is higher than the median of the population. We present the following metrics for the held out test dataset:\\n\\n1. NDCG@k: This measures the ranking quality of the recommended items up to position k. It accounts for the position of relevant items in the recommendation list, assigning higher scores when relevant items appear higher in the ranking. The gain is discounted logarithmically at lower ranks, and the result is normalized by the ideal ranking (i.e., the best possible ordering of items).\\n1. HR@k: This measures the proportion of test cases in which the ground-truth chosen item y appears in the top k recommendations. It is a binary metric per test case (hit or miss) and is averaged over all test cases.\\n1. MRR: MRR evaluates the ranking quality by measuring the reciprocal of the rank at which the chosen item appears in the recommendation list. The metric is averaged across all test cases.\\n1. Reward Model as A Judge: We use the reward model to evaluate the policy for future user events. We propose to use an ensemble of reward models for the evaluation to increase confidence. The result is based on the discounted reward generated for a few steps. The standard deviation is less than 4%.\\n\\nWe measure the percentage improvement in each metric compared to the baseline, Reward Weighted Behavior Cloning(BC). We notice that advantage weighted SFT shows the largest improvement in metrics, outweighing BC as well as reward model dependent algorithms like CQL, PPO, DPO and IPO.\\n\\nOur experiments show that advantage weighted SFT is a simple but promising approach for post-training generative recommenders as it deals with the issue of poor reward model generalizations and lack of IPS. More specifically, we find PPO, IPO and DPO achieve a good reward score, but also causes the overfitting from the reward model. Conservative Q-Learning achieves more robust improvements but does not fully capture the potential signals in the reward modeling.

Generative recommenders (GRs) represent a new paradigm in the field of recommendation systems (e.g.HSTU,OneRec). These models draw inspiration from recent advancements in transformer architectures used for language and vision tasks. They approach the recommendation problem, including both ranking and retrieval, as a sequential transduction task. This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models.

Check outpart 1andpart 2to learn more.\\n\\nPicture this: It’s seconds before the biggest fight night in Netflix history. Sixty-five million fans are waiting, devices in hand, hearts pounding. The countdown hits zero. What does it take to get everyone to the action on time, every time? At Netflix, we’re used to on-demand viewing where everyone chooses their own moment. But with live events, millions are eager to join in at once. Our job: make sure our members never miss a beat.\\n\\nWhen Live events break streaming records¹²³, our infrastructure faces the ultimate stress test. Here’s how we engineered a discovery experience for a global audience excited to see a knockout.\\n\\n## Why are Live Events Different?\\n\\nUnlike Video on Demand (VOD), members want to catch live events as they happen. There’s something uniquely exciting about being part of the moment. That means we only have a brief window to recommend a Live event at just the right time. Too early, excitement fades; too late, the moment is missed. Every second counts.\\n\\nTo capture that excitement, we enhanced our recommendation delivery systems to serve real-time suggestions, providing members richer and more compelling signals to hit play in the moment when it matters most. The challenge? Sending dynamic, timely updates concurrently to over a hundred million devices worldwide without creating athundering herd effectthat would overwhelm our cloud services. Simply scaling up linearly isn’t efficient and reliable. For popular events, it could also divert resources from other critical services. We needed a smarter and more scalable solution than just adding more resources.\\n\\n## Orchestrating the moment: Real-time Recommendations\\n\\nWith millions of devices online and live event schedules that can shift in real time, the challenge was to keep everyone perfectly in sync. We set out to solve this by building a system that doesn’t just react, but adapts by dynamically updating recommendations as the event unfolds. We identified the need to balance three constraints:\\n\\n* Time: the duration required to coordinate an update.\\n* Request throughput:the capacity of our cloud services to handle requests.\\n* Compute cardinality: the variety of requests necessary to serve a unique update.\\n\\nWe solved this constraint optimization problem by splitting the real-time recommendations into two phases:prefetchingandreal-time broadcasting. First, we prefetch the necessary data ahead of time, distributing the load over a longer period to avoid traffic spikes. When the Live event starts or ends, we broadcast a low cardinality message to all connected devices, prompting them to use the prefetched data locally. The timing of the broadcast also adapts when event times shift to preserve accuracy with the production of the Live event. By combining these two phases, we’re able to keep our members’ devices in sync and solve the thundering herd problem. To maximize device reach, especially for those with unstable networks, we use “at least once” broadcasts to ensure every device gets the latest updates and can catch up on any previously missed broadcasts as soon as they’re back online.\\n\\nThe first phase optimizesrequest throughputandcompute cardinalityby prefetching materialized recommendations, displayed title metadata, and artwork for a Live event. As members naturally browse their devices before the event, this data is prepopulated and stored locally in device cache, awaiting the notification trigger to serve the recommendations instantaneously. By distributing these requests naturally over time ahead of the event, we can eliminate any related traffic spikes and avoid the need for large-scale, real-time system scaling.\\n\\nThe second phase optimizesrequest throughputandtimeto updatedevices by broadcasting a low-cardinality, real-time message to all connected devices at critical moments in a Live event’s lifecycle. Each broadcast payload includes astate keyand atimestamp. The state key indicates the current stage of the Live event, allowing devices to use their pre-fetched data to update cached responses locally without additional server requests. The timestamp ensures that if a device misses a broadcast due to network issues, it can catch up by replaying missed updates upon reconnecting. This mechanism guarantees devices receive updates at least once, significantly increasing delivery reliability even on unstable networks.\\n\\n> Moment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\nMoment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\n## Under the Hood: How It Works\\n\\nWith the big picture in mind, let’s examine how these pieces interact in practice.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\nIn the diagram below, the Message Producer microservice centralizes all of the business logic. It continuously monitors live events for setup and timing changes. When it detects an update, it schedules broadcasts to be sent at precisely the right moment. The Message Producer also standardizes communication by providing a concise GraphQL schema for both device queries and broadcast payloads.\\n\\nRather than sending broadcasts directly to devices via WebSocket, the Message Producer hands them off to the Message Router. The Message Router is part of a robust two-tier pub/sub architecture built on proven technologies likePushy(our WebSocket proxy), Apache Kafka, andNetflix’s KV key-value store. The Message Router tracks subscriptions at the Pushy node granularity, while Pushy nodes map the subscriptions to individual connections, creating a low-latency fanout that minimizes compute and bandwidth requirements.\\n\\nDevices interface with our GraphQLDomain Graph Service (DGS). These schemas offer multiple query interfaces for prefetching, allowing devices to tailor their requests to the specific experience being presented. Each response adheres to a consistent API that resolves to a map of stage keys, enabling fast lookups and keeping business logic off the device. Our broadcast schema specifies WebSocket connection parameters, the current event stage, and the timestamp of the last broadcast message. When a device receives a broadcast, it injects the payload directly into its cache, triggering an immediate update and re-render of the interface.\\n\\n## Balancing the Moment: Throughput Management\\n\\nIn addition to building the new technology to support real-time recommendations, we also evaluated our existing systems for potential traffic hotspots. Using high-watermark traffic projections for live events, we generated synthetic traffic to simulate game-day scenarios and observed how our online services handled these bursts. Through this process, several common patterns emerged:\\n\\nBreaking the Cache Synchrony\\n\\nOur game-day simulations revealed that while our approach mitigated the immediate thundering herd risks driven by member traffic during the events, live events introduced unexpected mini thundering herds in our systems hours before and after the actual events. The surge of members joining just in time for these events led to concentrated cache expirations and recomputations, which created traffic spikes well outside the event window that we did not anticipate. This was not a problem for VOD content because the member traffic patterns are a lot smoother. We found that fixed TTLs caused cache expirations and refresh-traffic spikes to happen all at once. To address this, we added jitter to server and client cache expirations to spread out refreshes and smooth out traffic spikes.\\n\\nAdaptive Traffic Prioritization\\n\\nWhile our services already leverage traffic prioritization and partitioning based on factors such as request type and device type, live events introduced a distinct challenge. These events generated brief traffic bursts that were intensely spiky and placed significant strain on our systems. Through simulations, we recognized the need for an additional event-driven layer of traffic management.\\n\\nTo tackle this, we improved our traffic sharding strategies by using event-based signals. This enabled us to route live event traffic to dedicated clusters with more aggressive scaling policies. We also added a dynamic traffic prioritization ruleset that activates whenever we see high requests per second (RPS) to ensure our systems can handle the surge smoothly. During these peaks, we aggressively deprioritize non-critical server-driven updates so that our systems can devote resources to the most time-sensitive computations. This approach ensures smooth performance and reliability when demand is at its highest.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nWhen we set out to build a seamlessly scalable scheduled viewing experience, our goal was to create a dynamic and richer member experience for live content. Popular live events like the Crawford v. Canelo fight and the NFL Christmas games truly put our systems to the test. Along the way, we also uncovered valuable learnings that continue to shape our work. Our attempts to deprioritize traffic to other non-critical services caused unexpected call patterns and spikes in traffic elsewhere. Similarly, in hindsight, we also learned that the high traffic volume from popular events caused excessive non-essential logging and was putting unnecessary pressure on our ingestion pipelines.\\n\\nNone of this work would have been possible without our stunning colleagues at Netflix who collaborated across multiple functions to architect, build, and test these approaches, ensuring members can easily access events at the right moment: UI Engineering, Cloud Gateway, Data Science & Engineering, Search and Discovery, Evidence Engineering, Member Experience Foundations, Content Promotion and Distribution, Operations and Reliability, Device Playback, Experience and Design and Product Management.\\n\\nAs Netflix’s content offering expands to include new formats like live titles, free-to-air linear content, and games, we’re excited to build on what we’ve accomplished and look ahead to even more possibilities. Our roadmap includes extending the capabilities we developed for scheduled live viewing to these emerging formats. We’re also focused on enhancing our engineering tooling for greater visibility into operations, message delivery, and error handling to help us continue to deliver the best possible experience for our members.\\n\\n## Join Us for What’s Next\\n\\nWe’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible as we bring new live experiences to members around the world.

Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

Generative recommenders (GRs) represent a new paradigm in the field of recommendation systems (e.g.HSTU,OneRec). These models draw inspiration from recent advancements in transformer architectures used for language and vision tasks. They approach the recommendation problem, including both ranking and retrieval, as a sequential transduction task. This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens. The reward model uses an open-sourced HSTU architecture in the convenience of reproducing this study. We adopt the standard RLHF approach of training a reward model using offline, human-collected feedback. We start by creating a proxy reward, scored on a scale from 1 to 5 in the convenience of understanding. This reward model is co-trained as a shallow reward head on top of the generative recommender. It predicts the reward for the most recently selected title based on a user’s interaction history. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare the model’s performance against two simple baselines: (1) predicting the next reward as the average reward the user has given in their past interactions, and (2) predicting it as the average reward that all users have assigned to that particular title in previous interactions.\\n\\nTable 1: Reward model performance metrics\\n\\nWe observe that the model’s predictions do not significantly outperform the simple baselines. This result is intuitive, as a user’s historical interactions typically cover only a small subset of titles, making it difficult to accurately predict their responses to the vast number of unexplored titles in the catalogue. We expect this to be a potential issue for any large recommendation systems where the ratio between explored and unexplored titles is very small.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\n3. Lack of Logged Policy\\n\\nIn recommendation systems, the policy that generated the logged data is typically unknown and cannot be directly estimated. Offline reinforcement learning methods often rely on Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to debias such data by reweighting interactions according to the logging policy’s action probabilities. However, estimating the logging policy accurately is challenging and prone to error, which can introduce additional biases, and IPS itself is known to suffer from high variance. Consequently, offline RL approaches that depend on IPS are ill-suited for our setting.\\n\\n## Advantage Weighted Supervised Fine Tuning\\n\\nGiven the three challenges outlined above, we propose a new algorithm Advantage-Weighted SFT (A-SFT). It leverages a combination of supervised fine-tuning and advantage reweighting from reinforcement learning. The key observation is as follows. Despite the reward estimation for each individual event having a high uncertainty, we find the estimations of rewards contain directional signals between high-reward and low-reward events. These signals could help better align the model during post-training.\\n\\nA central factor in this study is the generalization ability of the reward model. Better generalization enables more accurate predictions of user preferences for unseen titles, thereby making exploration more effective. For reward models with moderate to high generalization power, both online RL methods such as PPO and offline RL methods such as CQL can perform effectively. However, in our setting, reward model generalization is worse than the language counterparts’, which makes these algorithms less appropriate. In addition, the use of techniques like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) introduces a heightened risk of high-variance estimates, prompting us to exclude algorithms such as off-policy REINFORCE.\\n\\nOur proposed method A-SFT does not rely on IPS. With no need of prior knowledge of the logging policy, it can be generally applied to cases where observation of the environments are limited or biased. This is particularly useful to the recommendation setting due to the user feedback loop and distribution shifts with time. Without knowing the logging policy, A-SFT still provides means to control the policy deviation between the current policy and logging policy by tuning the parameter. This design provides essential means to control the learnt bias from uncertain reward models. We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1. Rejection Sampling Direct Preference Optimization / Identity Preference Optimization (RS DPO/IPO): this is a variant of DPO/IPO where, for each user history x, \\u200bwe generate contrasting response pairs by training an ensemble of reward models to estimate confidence intervals for the reward of multiple potential responses y.

Generative recommenders (GRs) represent a new paradigm in the field of recommendation systems (e.g.HSTU,OneRec). These models draw inspiration from recent advancements in transformer architectures used for language and vision tasks. They approach the recommendation problem, including both ranking and retrieval, as a sequential transduction task. This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens. The reward model uses an open-sourced HSTU architecture in the convenience of reproducing this study. We adopt the standard RLHF approach of training a reward model using offline, human-collected feedback. We start by creating a proxy reward, scored on a scale from 1 to 5 in the convenience of understanding. This reward model is co-trained as a shallow reward head on top of the generative recommender. It predicts the reward for the most recently selected title based on a user’s interaction history. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare the model’s performance against two simple baselines: (1) predicting the next reward as the average reward the user has given in their past interactions, and (2) predicting it as the average reward that all users have assigned to that particular title in previous interactions.\\n\\nTable 1: Reward model performance metrics\\n\\nWe observe that the model’s predictions do not significantly outperform the simple baselines. This result is intuitive, as a user’s historical interactions typically cover only a small subset of titles, making it difficult to accurately predict their responses to the vast number of unexplored titles in the catalogue. We expect this to be a potential issue for any large recommendation systems where the ratio between explored and unexplored titles is very small.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\n3. Lack of Logged Policy\\n\\nIn recommendation systems, the policy that generated the logged data is typically unknown and cannot be directly estimated. Offline reinforcement learning methods often rely on Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to debias such data by reweighting interactions according to the logging policy’s action probabilities. However, estimating the logging policy accurately is challenging and prone to error, which can introduce additional biases, and IPS itself is known to suffer from high variance. Consequently, offline RL approaches that depend on IPS are ill-suited for our setting.\\n\\n## Advantage Weighted Supervised Fine Tuning\\n\\nGiven the three challenges outlined above, we propose a new algorithm Advantage-Weighted SFT (A-SFT). It leverages a combination of supervised fine-tuning and advantage reweighting from reinforcement learning. The key observation is as follows. Despite the reward estimation for each individual event having a high uncertainty, we find the estimations of rewards contain directional signals between high-reward and low-reward events. These signals could help better align the model during post-training.\\n\\nA central factor in this study is the generalization ability of the reward model. Better generalization enables more accurate predictions of user preferences for unseen titles, thereby making exploration more effective. For reward models with moderate to high generalization power, both online RL methods such as PPO and offline RL methods such as CQL can perform effectively. However, in our setting, reward model generalization is worse than the language counterparts’, which makes these algorithms less appropriate. In addition, the use of techniques like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) introduces a heightened risk of high-variance estimates, prompting us to exclude algorithms such as off-policy REINFORCE.\\n\\nOur proposed method A-SFT does not rely on IPS. With no need of prior knowledge of the logging policy, it can be generally applied to cases where observation of the environments are limited or biased. This is particularly useful to the recommendation setting due to the user feedback loop and distribution shifts with time. Without knowing the logging policy, A-SFT still provides means to control the policy deviation between the current policy and logging policy by tuning the parameter. This design provides essential means to control the learnt bias from uncertain reward models. We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1.

If the lower bound of the reward confidence interval for one response\\u200b is less than the upper bound for another response, then this pair is used to train DPO/IPO.\\n1.

Check outpart 1andpart 2to learn more.\\n\\nPicture this: It’s seconds before the biggest fight night in Netflix history. Sixty-five million fans are waiting, devices in hand, hearts pounding. The countdown hits zero. What does it take to get everyone to the action on time, every time? At Netflix, we’re used to on-demand viewing where everyone chooses their own moment. But with live events, millions are eager to join in at once. Our job: make sure our members never miss a beat.\\n\\nWhen Live events break streaming records¹²³, our infrastructure faces the ultimate stress test. Here’s how we engineered a discovery experience for a global audience excited to see a knockout.\\n\\n## Why are Live Events Different?\\n\\nUnlike Video on Demand (VOD), members want to catch live events as they happen. There’s something uniquely exciting about being part of the moment. That means we only have a brief window to recommend a Live event at just the right time. Too early, excitement fades; too late, the moment is missed. Every second counts.\\n\\nTo capture that excitement, we enhanced our recommendation delivery systems to serve real-time suggestions, providing members richer and more compelling signals to hit play in the moment when it matters most. The challenge? Sending dynamic, timely updates concurrently to over a hundred million devices worldwide without creating athundering herd effectthat would overwhelm our cloud services. Simply scaling up linearly isn’t efficient and reliable. For popular events, it could also divert resources from other critical services. We needed a smarter and more scalable solution than just adding more resources.\\n\\n## Orchestrating the moment: Real-time Recommendations\\n\\nWith millions of devices online and live event schedules that can shift in real time, the challenge was to keep everyone perfectly in sync. We set out to solve this by building a system that doesn’t just react, but adapts by dynamically updating recommendations as the event unfolds. We identified the need to balance three constraints:\\n\\n* Time: the duration required to coordinate an update.\\n* Request throughput:the capacity of our cloud services to handle requests.\\n* Compute cardinality: the variety of requests necessary to serve a unique update.\\n\\nWe solved this constraint optimization problem by splitting the real-time recommendations into two phases:prefetchingandreal-time broadcasting. First, we prefetch the necessary data ahead of time, distributing the load over a longer period to avoid traffic spikes. When the Live event starts or ends, we broadcast a low cardinality message to all connected devices, prompting them to use the prefetched data locally. The timing of the broadcast also adapts when event times shift to preserve accuracy with the production of the Live event. By combining these two phases, we’re able to keep our members’ devices in sync and solve the thundering herd problem. To maximize device reach, especially for those with unstable networks, we use “at least once” broadcasts to ensure every device gets the latest updates and can catch up on any previously missed broadcasts as soon as they’re back online.\\n\\nThe first phase optimizesrequest throughputandcompute cardinalityby prefetching materialized recommendations, displayed title metadata, and artwork for a Live event. As members naturally browse their devices before the event, this data is prepopulated and stored locally in device cache, awaiting the notification trigger to serve the recommendations instantaneously. By distributing these requests naturally over time ahead of the event, we can eliminate any related traffic spikes and avoid the need for large-scale, real-time system scaling.\\n\\nThe second phase optimizesrequest throughputandtimeto updatedevices by broadcasting a low-cardinality, real-time message to all connected devices at critical moments in a Live event’s lifecycle. Each broadcast payload includes astate keyand atimestamp. The state key indicates the current stage of the Live event, allowing devices to use their pre-fetched data to update cached responses locally without additional server requests. The timestamp ensures that if a device misses a broadcast due to network issues, it can catch up by replaying missed updates upon reconnecting. This mechanism guarantees devices receive updates at least once, significantly increasing delivery reliability even on unstable networks.\\n\\n> Moment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\nMoment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\n## Under the Hood: How It Works\\n\\nWith the big picture in mind, let’s examine how these pieces interact in practice.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\nIn the diagram below, the Message Producer microservice centralizes all of the business logic. It continuously monitors live events for setup and timing changes. When it detects an update, it schedules broadcasts to be sent at precisely the right moment. The Message Producer also standardizes communication by providing a concise GraphQL schema for both device queries and broadcast payloads.\\n\\nRather than sending broadcasts directly to devices via WebSocket, the Message Producer hands them off to the Message Router. The Message Router is part of a robust two-tier pub/sub architecture built on proven technologies likePushy(our WebSocket proxy), Apache Kafka, andNetflix’s KV key-value store. The Message Router tracks subscriptions at the Pushy node granularity, while Pushy nodes map the subscriptions to individual connections, creating a low-latency fanout that minimizes compute and bandwidth requirements.\\n\\nDevices interface with our GraphQLDomain Graph Service (DGS). These schemas offer multiple query interfaces for prefetching, allowing devices to tailor their requests to the specific experience being presented. Each response adheres to a consistent API that resolves to a map of stage keys, enabling fast lookups and keeping business logic off the device. Our broadcast schema specifies WebSocket connection parameters, the current event stage, and the timestamp of the last broadcast message. When a device receives a broadcast, it injects the payload directly into its cache, triggering an immediate update and re-render of the interface.\\n\\n## Balancing the Moment: Throughput Management\\n\\nIn addition to building the new technology to support real-time recommendations, we also evaluated our existing systems for potential traffic hotspots. Using high-watermark traffic projections for live events, we generated synthetic traffic to simulate game-day scenarios and observed how our online services handled these bursts. Through this process, several common patterns emerged:\\n\\nBreaking the Cache Synchrony\\n\\nOur game-day simulations revealed that while our approach mitigated the immediate thundering herd risks driven by member traffic during the events, live events introduced unexpected mini thundering herds in our systems hours before and after the actual events. The surge of members joining just in time for these events led to concentrated cache expirations and recomputations, which created traffic spikes well outside the event window that we did not anticipate. This was not a problem for VOD content because the member traffic patterns are a lot smoother. We found that fixed TTLs caused cache expirations and refresh-traffic spikes to happen all at once. To address this, we added jitter to server and client cache expirations to spread out refreshes and smooth out traffic spikes.\\n\\nAdaptive Traffic Prioritization\\n\\nWhile our services already leverage traffic prioritization and partitioning based on factors such as request type and device type, live events introduced a distinct challenge. These events generated brief traffic bursts that were intensely spiky and placed significant strain on our systems. Through simulations, we recognized the need for an additional event-driven layer of traffic management.\\n\\nTo tackle this, we improved our traffic sharding strategies by using event-based signals. This enabled us to route live event traffic to dedicated clusters with more aggressive scaling policies. We also added a dynamic traffic prioritization ruleset that activates whenever we see high requests per second (RPS) to ensure our systems can handle the surge smoothly. During these peaks, we aggressively deprioritize non-critical server-driven updates so that our systems can devote resources to the most time-sensitive computations. This approach ensures smooth performance and reliability when demand is at its highest.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nWhen we set out to build a seamlessly scalable scheduled viewing experience, our goal was to create a dynamic and richer member experience for live content. Popular live events like the Crawford v. Canelo fight and the NFL Christmas games truly put our systems to the test. Along the way, we also uncovered valuable learnings that continue to shape our work. Our attempts to deprioritize traffic to other non-critical services caused unexpected call patterns and spikes in traffic elsewhere. Similarly, in hindsight, we also learned that the high traffic volume from popular events caused excessive non-essential logging and was putting unnecessary pressure on our ingestion pipelines.\\n\\nNone of this work would have been possible without our stunning colleagues at Netflix who collaborated across multiple functions to architect, build, and test these approaches, ensuring members can easily access events at the right moment: UI Engineering, Cloud Gateway, Data Science & Engineering, Search and Discovery, Evidence Engineering, Member Experience Foundations, Content Promotion and Distribution, Operations and Reliability, Device Playback, Experience and Design and Product Management.\\n\\nAs Netflix’s content offering expands to include new formats like live titles, free-to-air linear content, and games, we’re excited to build on what we’ve accomplished and look ahead to even more possibilities. Our roadmap includes extending the capabilities we developed for scheduled live viewing to these emerging formats. We’re also focused on enhancing our engineering tooling for greater visibility into operations, message delivery, and error handling to help us continue to deliver the best possible experience for our members.\\n\\n## Join Us for What’s Next\\n\\nWe’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible as we bring new live experiences to members around the world.

Generative recommenders (GRs) represent a new paradigm in the field of recommendation systems (e.g.HSTU,OneRec). These models draw inspiration from recent advancements in transformer architectures used for language and vision tasks. They approach the recommendation problem, including both ranking and retrieval, as a sequential transduction task. This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens. The reward model uses an open-sourced HSTU architecture in the convenience of reproducing this study. We adopt the standard RLHF approach of training a reward model using offline, human-collected feedback. We start by creating a proxy reward, scored on a scale from 1 to 5 in the convenience of understanding. This reward model is co-trained as a shallow reward head on top of the generative recommender. It predicts the reward for the most recently selected title based on a user’s interaction history. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare the model’s performance against two simple baselines: (1) predicting the next reward as the average reward the user has given in their past interactions, and (2) predicting it as the average reward that all users have assigned to that particular title in previous interactions.\\n\\nTable 1: Reward model performance metrics\\n\\nWe observe that the model’s predictions do not significantly outperform the simple baselines. This result is intuitive, as a user’s historical interactions typically cover only a small subset of titles, making it difficult to accurately predict their responses to the vast number of unexplored titles in the catalogue. We expect this to be a potential issue for any large recommendation systems where the ratio between explored and unexplored titles is very small.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\n3. Lack of Logged Policy\\n\\nIn recommendation systems, the policy that generated the logged data is typically unknown and cannot be directly estimated. Offline reinforcement learning methods often rely on Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to debias such data by reweighting interactions according to the logging policy’s action probabilities. However, estimating the logging policy accurately is challenging and prone to error, which can introduce additional biases, and IPS itself is known to suffer from high variance. Consequently, offline RL approaches that depend on IPS are ill-suited for our setting.\\n\\n## Advantage Weighted Supervised Fine Tuning\\n\\nGiven the three challenges outlined above, we propose a new algorithm Advantage-Weighted SFT (A-SFT). It leverages a combination of supervised fine-tuning and advantage reweighting from reinforcement learning. The key observation is as follows. Despite the reward estimation for each individual event having a high uncertainty, we find the estimations of rewards contain directional signals between high-reward and low-reward events. These signals could help better align the model during post-training.\\n\\nA central factor in this study is the generalization ability of the reward model. Better generalization enables more accurate predictions of user preferences for unseen titles, thereby making exploration more effective. For reward models with moderate to high generalization power, both online RL methods such as PPO and offline RL methods such as CQL can perform effectively. However, in our setting, reward model generalization is worse than the language counterparts’, which makes these algorithms less appropriate. In addition, the use of techniques like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) introduces a heightened risk of high-variance estimates, prompting us to exclude algorithms such as off-policy REINFORCE.\\n\\nOur proposed method A-SFT does not rely on IPS. With no need of prior knowledge of the logging policy, it can be generally applied to cases where observation of the environments are limited or biased. This is particularly useful to the recommendation setting due to the user feedback loop and distribution shifts with time. Without knowing the logging policy, A-SFT still provides means to control the policy deviation between the current policy and logging policy by tuning the parameter. This design provides essential means to control the learnt bias from uncertain reward models. We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1. Rejection Sampling Direct Preference Optimization / Identity Preference Optimization (RS DPO/IPO): this is a variant of DPO/IPO where, for each user history x, \\u200bwe generate contrasting response pairs by training an ensemble of reward models to estimate confidence intervals for the reward of multiple potential responses y. If the lower bound of the reward confidence interval for one response\\u200b is less than the upper bound for another response, then this pair is used to train DPO/IPO.\\n1. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL): This is a standard offline algorithm that learns a conservative Q function, penalizing overestimation of Q-values, particularly in regions of the state-action space with little or no reward data.\\n1. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): This is a standard RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) algorithm that uses reward models as an online environment. PPO learns an advantage function and optimizes the policy to maximize expected reward while maintaining proximity to the initial policy.\\n\\nWe sampled a separate test set of O(Millions) users. This test set is collected on a future date after the training.\\n\\n## Offline Evaluation Results\\n\\nWe evaluate our algorithm on a dataset of high-reward user trajectories. For sake of simplicity, we consider a trajectory to have a high reward if the accumulated reward is higher than the median of the population. We present the following metrics for the held out test dataset:\\n\\n1. NDCG@k: This measures the ranking quality of the recommended items up to position k. It accounts for the position of relevant items in the recommendation list, assigning higher scores when relevant items appear higher in the ranking. The gain is discounted logarithmically at lower ranks, and the result is normalized by the ideal ranking (i.e., the best possible ordering of items).\\n1. HR@k: This measures the proportion of test cases in which the ground-truth chosen item y appears in the top k recommendations. It is a binary metric per test case (hit or miss) and is averaged over all test cases.\\n1. MRR: MRR evaluates the ranking quality by measuring the reciprocal of the rank at which the chosen item appears in the recommendation list. The metric is averaged across all test cases.\\n1. Reward Model as A Judge: We use the reward model to evaluate the policy for future user events. We propose to use an ensemble of reward models for the evaluation to increase confidence. The result is based on the discounted reward generated for a few steps. The standard deviation is less than 4%.\\n\\nWe measure the percentage improvement in each metric compared to the baseline, Reward Weighted Behavior Cloning(BC). We notice that advantage weighted SFT shows the largest improvement in metrics, outweighing BC as well as reward model dependent algorithms like CQL, PPO, DPO and IPO.\\n\\nOur experiments show that advantage weighted SFT is a simple but promising approach for post-training generative recommenders as it deals with the issue of poor reward model generalizations and lack of IPS. More specifically, we find PPO, IPO and DPO achieve a good reward score, but also causes the overfitting from the reward model. Conservative Q-Learning achieves more robust improvements but does not fully capture the potential signals in the reward modeling. A-SFT achieved both better recommendation metrics and reward scores.', 'title': 'Post-Training Generative Recommenders with Advantage-Weighted Supervised Finetuning', 'url': 'https://netflixtechblog.com/post-training-generative-recommenders-with-advantage-weighted-supervised-finetuning-61a538d717a9?source=collection_home_page----2615bd06b42e-----0-----------------------------------'}, {'markdown': 'Author:Keertana Chidambaram,Qiuling Xu,Ko-Jen Hsiao,Moumita Bhattacharya\\n\\n(*The work was done when Keertana interned at Netflix.)\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThis blog focuses on post-training generative recommender systems.

The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens. The reward model uses an open-sourced HSTU architecture in the convenience of reproducing this study. We adopt the standard RLHF approach of training a reward model using offline, human-collected feedback. We start by creating a proxy reward, scored on a scale from 1 to 5 in the convenience of understanding. This reward model is co-trained as a shallow reward head on top of the generative recommender. It predicts the reward for the most recently selected title based on a user’s interaction history. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare the model’s performance against two simple baselines: (1) predicting the next reward as the average reward the user has given in their past interactions, and (2) predicting it as the average reward that all users have assigned to that particular title in previous interactions.\\n\\nTable 1: Reward model performance metrics\\n\\nWe observe that the model’s predictions do not significantly outperform the simple baselines. This result is intuitive, as a user’s historical interactions typically cover only a small subset of titles, making it difficult to accurately predict their responses to the vast number of unexplored titles in the catalogue. We expect this to be a potential issue for any large recommendation systems where the ratio between explored and unexplored titles is very small.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\n3. Lack of Logged Policy\\n\\nIn recommendation systems, the policy that generated the logged data is typically unknown and cannot be directly estimated. Offline reinforcement learning methods often rely on Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to debias such data by reweighting interactions according to the logging policy’s action probabilities. However, estimating the logging policy accurately is challenging and prone to error, which can introduce additional biases, and IPS itself is known to suffer from high variance. Consequently, offline RL approaches that depend on IPS are ill-suited for our setting.\\n\\n## Advantage Weighted Supervised Fine Tuning\\n\\nGiven the three challenges outlined above, we propose a new algorithm Advantage-Weighted SFT (A-SFT). It leverages a combination of supervised fine-tuning and advantage reweighting from reinforcement learning. The key observation is as follows. Despite the reward estimation for each individual event having a high uncertainty, we find the estimations of rewards contain directional signals between high-reward and low-reward events. These signals could help better align the model during post-training.\\n\\nA central factor in this study is the generalization ability of the reward model. Better generalization enables more accurate predictions of user preferences for unseen titles, thereby making exploration more effective. For reward models with moderate to high generalization power, both online RL methods such as PPO and offline RL methods such as CQL can perform effectively. However, in our setting, reward model generalization is worse than the language counterparts’, which makes these algorithms less appropriate. In addition, the use of techniques like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) introduces a heightened risk of high-variance estimates, prompting us to exclude algorithms such as off-policy REINFORCE.\\n\\nOur proposed method A-SFT does not rely on IPS. With no need of prior knowledge of the logging policy, it can be generally applied to cases where observation of the environments are limited or biased. This is particularly useful to the recommendation setting due to the user feedback loop and distribution shifts with time. Without knowing the logging policy, A-SFT still provides means to control the policy deviation between the current policy and logging policy by tuning the parameter. This design provides essential means to control the learnt bias from uncertain reward models. We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1. Rejection Sampling Direct Preference Optimization / Identity Preference Optimization (RS DPO/IPO): this is a variant of DPO/IPO where, for each user history x, \\u200bwe generate contrasting response pairs by training an ensemble of reward models to estimate confidence intervals for the reward of multiple potential responses y. If the lower bound of the reward confidence interval for one response\\u200b is less than the upper bound for another response, then this pair is used to train DPO/IPO.\\n1. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL): This is a standard offline algorithm that learns a conservative Q function, penalizing overestimation of Q-values, particularly in regions of the state-action space with little or no reward data.\\n1. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): This is a standard RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) algorithm that uses reward models as an online environment. PPO learns an advantage function and optimizes the policy to maximize expected reward while maintaining proximity to the initial policy.\\n\\nWe sampled a separate test set of O(Millions) users. This test set is collected on a future date after the training.\\n\\n## Offline Evaluation Results\\n\\nWe evaluate our algorithm on a dataset of high-reward user trajectories. For sake of simplicity, we consider a trajectory to have a high reward if the accumulated reward is higher than the median of the population. We present the following metrics for the held out test dataset:\\n\\n1. NDCG@k: This measures the ranking quality of the recommended items up to position k. It accounts for the position of relevant items in the recommendation list, assigning higher scores when relevant items appear higher in the ranking. The gain is discounted logarithmically at lower ranks, and the result is normalized by the ideal ranking (i.e., the best possible ordering of items).\\n1. HR@k: This measures the proportion of test cases in which the ground-truth chosen item y appears in the top k recommendations. It is a binary metric per test case (hit or miss) and is averaged over all test cases.\\n1. MRR: MRR evaluates the ranking quality by measuring the reciprocal of the rank at which the chosen item appears in the recommendation list. The metric is averaged across all test cases.\\n1. Reward Model as A Judge: We use the reward model to evaluate the policy for future user events. We propose to use an ensemble of reward models for the evaluation to increase confidence. The result is based on the discounted reward generated for a few steps. The standard deviation is less than 4%.\\n\\nWe measure the percentage improvement in each metric compared to the baseline, Reward Weighted Behavior Cloning(BC). We notice that advantage weighted SFT shows the largest improvement in metrics, outweighing BC as well as reward model dependent algorithms like CQL, PPO, DPO and IPO.\\n\\nOur experiments show that advantage weighted SFT is a simple but promising approach for post-training generative recommenders as it deals with the issue of poor reward model generalizations and lack of IPS. More specifically, we find PPO, IPO and DPO achieve a good reward score, but also causes the overfitting from the reward model. Conservative Q-Learning achieves more robust improvements but does not fully capture the potential signals in the reward modeling.

Check outpart 1andpart 2to learn more.\\n\\nPicture this: It’s seconds before the biggest fight night in Netflix history. Sixty-five million fans are waiting, devices in hand, hearts pounding. The countdown hits zero. What does it take to get everyone to the action on time, every time? At Netflix, we’re used to on-demand viewing where everyone chooses their own moment. But with live events, millions are eager to join in at once. Our job: make sure our members never miss a beat.\\n\\nWhen Live events break streaming records¹²³, our infrastructure faces the ultimate stress test. Here’s how we engineered a discovery experience for a global audience excited to see a knockout.\\n\\n## Why are Live Events Different?\\n\\nUnlike Video on Demand (VOD), members want to catch live events as they happen. There’s something uniquely exciting about being part of the moment. That means we only have a brief window to recommend a Live event at just the right time. Too early, excitement fades; too late, the moment is missed. Every second counts.\\n\\nTo capture that excitement, we enhanced our recommendation delivery systems to serve real-time suggestions, providing members richer and more compelling signals to hit play in the moment when it matters most. The challenge? Sending dynamic, timely updates concurrently to over a hundred million devices worldwide without creating athundering herd effectthat would overwhelm our cloud services. Simply scaling up linearly isn’t efficient and reliable. For popular events, it could also divert resources from other critical services. We needed a smarter and more scalable solution than just adding more resources.\\n\\n## Orchestrating the moment: Real-time Recommendations\\n\\nWith millions of devices online and live event schedules that can shift in real time, the challenge was to keep everyone perfectly in sync. We set out to solve this by building a system that doesn’t just react, but adapts by dynamically updating recommendations as the event unfolds. We identified the need to balance three constraints:\\n\\n* Time: the duration required to coordinate an update.\\n* Request throughput:the capacity of our cloud services to handle requests.\\n* Compute cardinality: the variety of requests necessary to serve a unique update.\\n\\nWe solved this constraint optimization problem by splitting the real-time recommendations into two phases:prefetchingandreal-time broadcasting. First, we prefetch the necessary data ahead of time, distributing the load over a longer period to avoid traffic spikes. When the Live event starts or ends, we broadcast a low cardinality message to all connected devices, prompting them to use the prefetched data locally. The timing of the broadcast also adapts when event times shift to preserve accuracy with the production of the Live event. By combining these two phases, we’re able to keep our members’ devices in sync and solve the thundering herd problem. To maximize device reach, especially for those with unstable networks, we use “at least once” broadcasts to ensure every device gets the latest updates and can catch up on any previously missed broadcasts as soon as they’re back online.\\n\\nThe first phase optimizesrequest throughputandcompute cardinalityby prefetching materialized recommendations, displayed title metadata, and artwork for a Live event. As members naturally browse their devices before the event, this data is prepopulated and stored locally in device cache, awaiting the notification trigger to serve the recommendations instantaneously. By distributing these requests naturally over time ahead of the event, we can eliminate any related traffic spikes and avoid the need for large-scale, real-time system scaling.\\n\\nThe second phase optimizesrequest throughputandtimeto updatedevices by broadcasting a low-cardinality, real-time message to all connected devices at critical moments in a Live event’s lifecycle. Each broadcast payload includes astate keyand atimestamp. The state key indicates the current stage of the Live event, allowing devices to use their pre-fetched data to update cached responses locally without additional server requests. The timestamp ensures that if a device misses a broadcast due to network issues, it can catch up by replaying missed updates upon reconnecting. This mechanism guarantees devices receive updates at least once, significantly increasing delivery reliability even on unstable networks.\\n\\n> Moment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\nMoment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\n## Under the Hood: How It Works\\n\\nWith the big picture in mind, let’s examine how these pieces interact in practice.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\nIn the diagram below, the Message Producer microservice centralizes all of the business logic. It continuously monitors live events for setup and timing changes. When it detects an update, it schedules broadcasts to be sent at precisely the right moment. The Message Producer also standardizes communication by providing a concise GraphQL schema for both device queries and broadcast payloads.\\n\\nRather than sending broadcasts directly to devices via WebSocket, the Message Producer hands them off to the Message Router. The Message Router is part of a robust two-tier pub/sub architecture built on proven technologies likePushy(our WebSocket proxy), Apache Kafka, andNetflix’s KV key-value store. The Message Router tracks subscriptions at the Pushy node granularity, while Pushy nodes map the subscriptions to individual connections, creating a low-latency fanout that minimizes compute and bandwidth requirements.\\n\\nDevices interface with our GraphQLDomain Graph Service (DGS). These schemas offer multiple query interfaces for prefetching, allowing devices to tailor their requests to the specific experience being presented. Each response adheres to a consistent API that resolves to a map of stage keys, enabling fast lookups and keeping business logic off the device. Our broadcast schema specifies WebSocket connection parameters, the current event stage, and the timestamp of the last broadcast message. When a device receives a broadcast, it injects the payload directly into its cache, triggering an immediate update and re-render of the interface.\\n\\n## Balancing the Moment: Throughput Management\\n\\nIn addition to building the new technology to support real-time recommendations, we also evaluated our existing systems for potential traffic hotspots. Using high-watermark traffic projections for live events, we generated synthetic traffic to simulate game-day scenarios and observed how our online services handled these bursts. Through this process, several common patterns emerged:\\n\\nBreaking the Cache Synchrony\\n\\nOur game-day simulations revealed that while our approach mitigated the immediate thundering herd risks driven by member traffic during the events, live events introduced unexpected mini thundering herds in our systems hours before and after the actual events. The surge of members joining just in time for these events led to concentrated cache expirations and recomputations, which created traffic spikes well outside the event window that we did not anticipate. This was not a problem for VOD content because the member traffic patterns are a lot smoother. We found that fixed TTLs caused cache expirations and refresh-traffic spikes to happen all at once. To address this, we added jitter to server and client cache expirations to spread out refreshes and smooth out traffic spikes.\\n\\nAdaptive Traffic Prioritization\\n\\nWhile our services already leverage traffic prioritization and partitioning based on factors such as request type and device type, live events introduced a distinct challenge. These events generated brief traffic bursts that were intensely spiky and placed significant strain on our systems. Through simulations, we recognized the need for an additional event-driven layer of traffic management.\\n\\nTo tackle this, we improved our traffic sharding strategies by using event-based signals. This enabled us to route live event traffic to dedicated clusters with more aggressive scaling policies. We also added a dynamic traffic prioritization ruleset that activates whenever we see high requests per second (RPS) to ensure our systems can handle the surge smoothly. During these peaks, we aggressively deprioritize non-critical server-driven updates so that our systems can devote resources to the most time-sensitive computations. This approach ensures smooth performance and reliability when demand is at its highest.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nWhen we set out to build a seamlessly scalable scheduled viewing experience, our goal was to create a dynamic and richer member experience for live content. Popular live events like the Crawford v. Canelo fight and the NFL Christmas games truly put our systems to the test. Along the way, we also uncovered valuable learnings that continue to shape our work. Our attempts to deprioritize traffic to other non-critical services caused unexpected call patterns and spikes in traffic elsewhere. Similarly, in hindsight, we also learned that the high traffic volume from popular events caused excessive non-essential logging and was putting unnecessary pressure on our ingestion pipelines.\\n\\nNone of this work would have been possible without our stunning colleagues at Netflix who collaborated across multiple functions to architect, build, and test these approaches, ensuring members can easily access events at the right moment: UI Engineering, Cloud Gateway, Data Science & Engineering, Search and Discovery, Evidence Engineering, Member Experience Foundations, Content Promotion and Distribution, Operations and Reliability, Device Playback, Experience and Design and Product Management.\\n\\nAs Netflix’s content offering expands to include new formats like live titles, free-to-air linear content, and games, we’re excited to build on what we’ve accomplished and look ahead to even more possibilities. Our roadmap includes extending the capabilities we developed for scheduled live viewing to these emerging formats. We’re also focused on enhancing our engineering tooling for greater visibility into operations, message delivery, and error handling to help us continue to deliver the best possible experience for our members.\\n\\n## Join Us for What’s Next\\n\\nWe’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible as we bring new live experiences to members around the world.

Generative recommenders (GRs) represent a new paradigm in the field of recommendation systems (e.g.HSTU,OneRec). These models draw inspiration from recent advancements in transformer architectures used for language and vision tasks. They approach the recommendation problem, including both ranking and retrieval, as a sequential transduction task. This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens. The reward model uses an open-sourced HSTU architecture in the convenience of reproducing this study. We adopt the standard RLHF approach of training a reward model using offline, human-collected feedback. We start by creating a proxy reward, scored on a scale from 1 to 5 in the convenience of understanding. This reward model is co-trained as a shallow reward head on top of the generative recommender. It predicts the reward for the most recently selected title based on a user’s interaction history. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare the model’s performance against two simple baselines: (1) predicting the next reward as the average reward the user has given in their past interactions, and (2) predicting it as the average reward that all users have assigned to that particular title in previous interactions.\\n\\nTable 1: Reward model performance metrics\\n\\nWe observe that the model’s predictions do not significantly outperform the simple baselines. This result is intuitive, as a user’s historical interactions typically cover only a small subset of titles, making it difficult to accurately predict their responses to the vast number of unexplored titles in the catalogue. We expect this to be a potential issue for any large recommendation systems where the ratio between explored and unexplored titles is very small.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\n3. Lack of Logged Policy\\n\\nIn recommendation systems, the policy that generated the logged data is typically unknown and cannot be directly estimated. Offline reinforcement learning methods often rely on Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to debias such data by reweighting interactions according to the logging policy’s action probabilities. However, estimating the logging policy accurately is challenging and prone to error, which can introduce additional biases, and IPS itself is known to suffer from high variance. Consequently, offline RL approaches that depend on IPS are ill-suited for our setting.\\n\\n## Advantage Weighted Supervised Fine Tuning\\n\\nGiven the three challenges outlined above, we propose a new algorithm Advantage-Weighted SFT (A-SFT). It leverages a combination of supervised fine-tuning and advantage reweighting from reinforcement learning. The key observation is as follows. Despite the reward estimation for each individual event having a high uncertainty, we find the estimations of rewards contain directional signals between high-reward and low-reward events. These signals could help better align the model during post-training.\\n\\nA central factor in this study is the generalization ability of the reward model. Better generalization enables more accurate predictions of user preferences for unseen titles, thereby making exploration more effective. For reward models with moderate to high generalization power, both online RL methods such as PPO and offline RL methods such as CQL can perform effectively. However, in our setting, reward model generalization is worse than the language counterparts’, which makes these algorithms less appropriate. In addition, the use of techniques like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) introduces a heightened risk of high-variance estimates, prompting us to exclude algorithms such as off-policy REINFORCE.\\n\\nOur proposed method A-SFT does not rely on IPS. With no need of prior knowledge of the logging policy, it can be generally applied to cases where observation of the environments are limited or biased. This is particularly useful to the recommendation setting due to the user feedback loop and distribution shifts with time. Without knowing the logging policy, A-SFT still provides means to control the policy deviation between the current policy and logging policy by tuning the parameter. This design provides essential means to control the learnt bias from uncertain reward models. We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1. Rejection Sampling Direct Preference Optimization / Identity Preference Optimization (RS DPO/IPO): this is a variant of DPO/IPO where, for each user history x, \\u200bwe generate contrasting response pairs by training an ensemble of reward models to estimate confidence intervals for the reward of multiple potential responses y. If the lower bound of the reward confidence interval for one response\\u200b is less than the upper bound for another response, then this pair is used to train DPO/IPO.\\n1. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL): This is a standard offline algorithm that learns a conservative Q function, penalizing overestimation of Q-values, particularly in regions of the state-action space with little or no reward data.\\n1. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): This is a standard RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) algorithm that uses reward models as an online environment. PPO learns an advantage function and optimizes the policy to maximize expected reward while maintaining proximity to the initial policy.\\n\\nWe sampled a separate test set of O(Millions) users. This test set is collected on a future date after the training.\\n\\n## Offline Evaluation Results\\n\\nWe evaluate our algorithm on a dataset of high-reward user trajectories. For sake of simplicity, we consider a trajectory to have a high reward if the accumulated reward is higher than the median of the population. We present the following metrics for the held out test dataset:\\n\\n1. NDCG@k: This measures the ranking quality of the recommended items up to position k. It accounts for the position of relevant items in the recommendation list, assigning higher scores when relevant items appear higher in the ranking. The gain is discounted logarithmically at lower ranks, and the result is normalized by the ideal ranking (i.e., the best possible ordering of items).\\n1. HR@k: This measures the proportion of test cases in which the ground-truth chosen item y appears in the top k recommendations. It is a binary metric per test case (hit or miss) and is averaged over all test cases.\\n1. MRR: MRR evaluates the ranking quality by measuring the reciprocal of the rank at which the chosen item appears in the recommendation list. The metric is averaged across all test cases.\\n1. Reward Model as A Judge: We use the reward model to evaluate the policy for future user events. We propose to use an ensemble of reward models for the evaluation to increase confidence. The result is based on the discounted reward generated for a few steps. The standard deviation is less than 4%.\\n\\nWe measure the percentage improvement in each metric compared to the baseline, Reward Weighted Behavior Cloning(BC). We notice that advantage weighted SFT shows the largest improvement in metrics, outweighing BC as well as reward model dependent algorithms like CQL, PPO, DPO and IPO.\\n\\nOur experiments show that advantage weighted SFT is a simple but promising approach for post-training generative recommenders as it deals with the issue of poor reward model generalizations and lack of IPS. More specifically, we find PPO, IPO and DPO achieve a good reward score, but also causes the overfitting from the reward model. Conservative Q-Learning achieves more robust improvements but does not fully capture the potential signals in the reward modeling. A-SFT achieved both better recommendation metrics and reward scores.', 'title': 'Post-Training Generative Recommenders with Advantage-Weighted Supervised Finetuning', 'url': 'https://netflixtechblog.com/post-training-generative-recommenders-with-advantage-weighted-supervised-finetuning-61a538d717a9?source=collection_home_page----2615bd06b42e-----0-----------------------------------'}, {'markdown': 'Author:Keertana Chidambaram,Qiuling Xu,Ko-Jen Hsiao,Moumita Bhattacharya\\n\\n(*The work was done when Keertana interned at Netflix.)\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThis blog focuses on post-training generative recommender systems.

We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1. Rejection Sampling Direct Preference Optimization / Identity Preference Optimization (RS DPO/IPO): this is a variant of DPO/IPO where, for each user history x, \\u200bwe generate contrasting response pairs by training an ensemble of reward models to estimate confidence intervals for the reward of multiple potential responses y. If the lower bound of the reward confidence interval for one response\\u200b is less than the upper bound for another response, then this pair is used to train DPO/IPO.\\n1. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL): This is a standard offline algorithm that learns a conservative Q function, penalizing overestimation of Q-values, particularly in regions of the state-action space with little or no reward data.\\n1. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): This is a standard RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) algorithm that uses reward models as an online environment. PPO learns an advantage function and optimizes the policy to maximize expected reward while maintaining proximity to the initial policy.\\n\\nWe sampled a separate test set of O(Millions) users. This test set is collected on a future date after the training.\\n\\n## Offline Evaluation Results\\n\\nWe evaluate our algorithm on a dataset of high-reward user trajectories. For sake of simplicity, we consider a trajectory to have a high reward if the accumulated reward is higher than the median of the population. We present the following metrics for the held out test dataset:\\n\\n1. NDCG@k: This measures the ranking quality of the recommended items up to position k. It accounts for the position of relevant items in the recommendation list, assigning higher scores when relevant items appear higher in the ranking. The gain is discounted logarithmically at lower ranks, and the result is normalized by the ideal ranking (i.e., the best possible ordering of items).\\n1. HR@k: This measures the proportion of test cases in which the ground-truth chosen item y appears in the top k recommendations. It is a binary metric per test case (hit or miss) and is averaged over all test cases.\\n1. MRR: MRR evaluates the ranking quality by measuring the reciprocal of the rank at which the chosen item appears in the recommendation list. The metric is averaged across all test cases.\\n1. Reward Model as A Judge: We use the reward model to evaluate the policy for future user events. We propose to use an ensemble of reward models for the evaluation to increase confidence. The result is based on the discounted reward generated for a few steps. The standard deviation is less than 4%.\\n\\nWe measure the percentage improvement in each metric compared to the baseline, Reward Weighted Behavior Cloning(BC). We notice that advantage weighted SFT shows the largest improvement in metrics, outweighing BC as well as reward model dependent algorithms like CQL, PPO, DPO and IPO.\\n\\nOur experiments show that advantage weighted SFT is a simple but promising approach for post-training generative recommenders as it deals with the issue of poor reward model generalizations and lack of IPS. More specifically, we find PPO, IPO and DPO achieve a good reward score, but also causes the overfitting from the reward model. Conservative Q-Learning achieves more robust improvements but does not fully capture the potential signals in the reward modeling. A-SFT achieved both better recommendation metrics and reward scores.', 'title': 'Post-Training Generative Recommenders with Advantage-Weighted Supervised Finetuning', 'url': 'https://netflixtechblog.com/post-training-generative-recommenders-with-advantage-weighted-supervised-finetuning-61a538d717a9?source=collection_home_page----2615bd06b42e-----0-----------------------------------'}, {'markdown': 'By:Kris Range,Ankush Gulati,Jim Isaacs,Jennifer Shin,Jeremy Kelly,Jason Tu\\n\\nThis is part 3 in a series called “Behind the Streams”. Check outpart 1andpart 2to learn more.\\n\\nPicture this: It’s seconds before the biggest fight night in Netflix history. Sixty-five million fans are waiting, devices in hand, hearts pounding. The countdown hits zero. What does it take to get everyone to the action on time, every time? At Netflix, we’re used to on-demand viewing where everyone chooses their own moment. But with live events, millions are eager to join in at once. Our job: make sure our members never miss a beat.\\n\\nWhen Live events break streaming records¹²³, our infrastructure faces the ultimate stress test. Here’s how we engineered a discovery experience for a global audience excited to see a knockout.\\n\\n## Why are Live Events Different?\\n\\nUnlike Video on Demand (VOD), members want to catch live events as they happen. There’s something uniquely exciting about being part of the moment. That means we only have a brief window to recommend a Live event at just the right time. Too early, excitement fades; too late, the moment is missed. Every second counts.\\n\\nTo capture that excitement, we enhanced our recommendation delivery systems to serve real-time suggestions, providing members richer and more compelling signals to hit play in the moment when it matters most. The challenge? Sending dynamic, timely updates concurrently to over a hundred million devices worldwide without creating athundering herd effectthat would overwhelm our cloud services. Simply scaling up linearly isn’t efficient and reliable. For popular events, it could also divert resources from other critical services. We needed a smarter and more scalable solution than just adding more resources.\\n\\n## Orchestrating the moment: Real-time Recommendations\\n\\nWith millions of devices online and live event schedules that can shift in real time, the challenge was to keep everyone perfectly in sync. We set out to solve this by building a system that doesn’t just react, but adapts by dynamically updating recommendations as the event unfolds. We identified the need to balance three constraints:\\n\\n* Time: the duration required to coordinate an update.\\n* Request throughput:the capacity of our cloud services to handle requests.\\n* Compute cardinality: the variety of requests necessary to serve a unique update.\\n\\nWe solved this constraint optimization problem by splitting the real-time recommendations into two phases:prefetchingandreal-time broadcasting. First, we prefetch the necessary data ahead of time, distributing the load over a longer period to avoid traffic spikes. When the Live event starts or ends, we broadcast a low cardinality message to all connected devices, prompting them to use the prefetched data locally. The timing of the broadcast also adapts when event times shift to preserve accuracy with the production of the Live event. By combining these two phases, we’re able to keep our members’ devices in sync and solve the thundering herd problem. To maximize device reach, especially for those with unstable networks, we use “at least once” broadcasts to ensure every device gets the latest updates and can catch up on any previously missed broadcasts as soon as they’re back online.\\n\\nThe first phase optimizesrequest throughputandcompute cardinalityby prefetching materialized recommendations, displayed title metadata, and artwork for a Live event. As members naturally browse their devices before the event, this data is prepopulated and stored locally in device cache, awaiting the notification trigger to serve the recommendations instantaneously. By distributing these requests naturally over time ahead of the event, we can eliminate any related traffic spikes and avoid the need for large-scale, real-time system scaling.\\n\\nThe second phase optimizesrequest throughputandtimeto updatedevices by broadcasting a low-cardinality, real-time message to all connected devices at critical moments in a Live event’s lifecycle. Each broadcast payload includes astate keyand atimestamp. The state key indicates the current stage of the Live event, allowing devices to use their pre-fetched data to update cached responses locally without additional server requests. The timestamp ensures that if a device misses a broadcast due to network issues, it can catch up by replaying missed updates upon reconnecting. This mechanism guarantees devices receive updates at least once, significantly increasing delivery reliability even on unstable networks.\\n\\n> Moment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\nMoment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\n## Under the Hood: How It Works\\n\\nWith the big picture in mind, let’s examine how these pieces interact in practice.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\nIn the diagram below, the Message Producer microservice centralizes all of the business logic. It continuously monitors live events for setup and timing changes. When it detects an update, it schedules broadcasts to be sent at precisely the right moment. The Message Producer also standardizes communication by providing a concise GraphQL schema for both device queries and broadcast payloads.\\n\\nRather than sending broadcasts directly to devices via WebSocket, the Message Producer hands them off to the Message Router. The Message Router is part of a robust two-tier pub/sub architecture built on proven technologies likePushy(our WebSocket proxy), Apache Kafka, andNetflix’s KV key-value store. The Message Router tracks subscriptions at the Pushy node granularity, while Pushy nodes map the subscriptions to individual connections, creating a low-latency fanout that minimizes compute and bandwidth requirements.\\n\\nDevices interface with our GraphQLDomain Graph Service (DGS). These schemas offer multiple query interfaces for prefetching, allowing devices to tailor their requests to the specific experience being presented. Each response adheres to a consistent API that resolves to a map of stage keys, enabling fast lookups and keeping business logic off the device. Our broadcast schema specifies WebSocket connection parameters, the current event stage, and the timestamp of the last broadcast message. When a device receives a broadcast, it injects the payload directly into its cache, triggering an immediate update and re-render of the interface.\\n\\n## Balancing the Moment: Throughput Management\\n\\nIn addition to building the new technology to support real-time recommendations, we also evaluated our existing systems for potential traffic hotspots. Using high-watermark traffic projections for live events, we generated synthetic traffic to simulate game-day scenarios and observed how our online services handled these bursts. Through this process, several common patterns emerged:\\n\\nBreaking the Cache Synchrony\\n\\nOur game-day simulations revealed that while our approach mitigated the immediate thundering herd risks driven by member traffic during the events, live events introduced unexpected mini thundering herds in our systems hours before and after the actual events. The surge of members joining just in time for these events led to concentrated cache expirations and recomputations, which created traffic spikes well outside the event window that we did not anticipate. This was not a problem for VOD content because the member traffic patterns are a lot smoother. We found that fixed TTLs caused cache expirations and refresh-traffic spikes to happen all at once. To address this, we added jitter to server and client cache expirations to spread out refreshes and smooth out traffic spikes.\\n\\nAdaptive Traffic Prioritization\\n\\nWhile our services already leverage traffic prioritization and partitioning based on factors such as request type and device type, live events introduced a distinct challenge. These events generated brief traffic bursts that were intensely spiky and placed significant strain on our systems. Through simulations, we recognized the need for an additional event-driven layer of traffic management.\\n\\nTo tackle this, we improved our traffic sharding strategies by using event-based signals. This enabled us to route live event traffic to dedicated clusters with more aggressive scaling policies. We also added a dynamic traffic prioritization ruleset that activates whenever we see high requests per second (RPS) to ensure our systems can handle the surge smoothly. During these peaks, we aggressively deprioritize non-critical server-driven updates so that our systems can devote resources to the most time-sensitive computations. This approach ensures smooth performance and reliability when demand is at its highest.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nWhen we set out to build a seamlessly scalable scheduled viewing experience, our goal was to create a dynamic and richer member experience for live content. Popular live events like the Crawford v. Canelo fight and the NFL Christmas games truly put our systems to the test. Along the way, we also uncovered valuable learnings that continue to shape our work. Our attempts to deprioritize traffic to other non-critical services caused unexpected call patterns and spikes in traffic elsewhere. Similarly, in hindsight, we also learned that the high traffic volume from popular events caused excessive non-essential logging and was putting unnecessary pressure on our ingestion pipelines.\\n\\nNone of this work would have been possible without our stunning colleagues at Netflix who collaborated across multiple functions to architect, build, and test these approaches, ensuring members can easily access events at the right moment: UI Engineering, Cloud Gateway, Data Science & Engineering, Search and Discovery, Evidence Engineering, Member Experience Foundations, Content Promotion and Distribution, Operations and Reliability, Device Playback, Experience and Design and Product Management.\\n\\nAs Netflix’s content offering expands to include new formats like live titles, free-to-air linear content, and games, we’re excited to build on what we’ve accomplished and look ahead to even more possibilities. Our roadmap includes extending the capabilities we developed for scheduled live viewing to these emerging formats. We’re also focused on enhancing our engineering tooling for greater visibility into operations, message delivery, and error handling to help us continue to deliver the best possible experience for our members.\\n\\n## Join Us for What’s Next\\n\\nWe’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible as we bring new live experiences to members around the world.

Generative recommenders (GRs) represent a new paradigm in the field of recommendation systems (e.g.HSTU,OneRec). These models draw inspiration from recent advancements in transformer architectures used for language and vision tasks. They approach the recommendation problem, including both ranking and retrieval, as a sequential transduction task. This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens. The reward model uses an open-sourced HSTU architecture in the convenience of reproducing this study. We adopt the standard RLHF approach of training a reward model using offline, human-collected feedback. We start by creating a proxy reward, scored on a scale from 1 to 5 in the convenience of understanding. This reward model is co-trained as a shallow reward head on top of the generative recommender. It predicts the reward for the most recently selected title based on a user’s interaction history. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare the model’s performance against two simple baselines: (1) predicting the next reward as the average reward the user has given in their past interactions, and (2) predicting it as the average reward that all users have assigned to that particular title in previous interactions.\\n\\nTable 1: Reward model performance metrics\\n\\nWe observe that the model’s predictions do not significantly outperform the simple baselines. This result is intuitive, as a user’s historical interactions typically cover only a small subset of titles, making it difficult to accurately predict their responses to the vast number of unexplored titles in the catalogue. We expect this to be a potential issue for any large recommendation systems where the ratio between explored and unexplored titles is very small.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\n3. Lack of Logged Policy\\n\\nIn recommendation systems, the policy that generated the logged data is typically unknown and cannot be directly estimated. Offline reinforcement learning methods often rely on Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to debias such data by reweighting interactions according to the logging policy’s action probabilities. However, estimating the logging policy accurately is challenging and prone to error, which can introduce additional biases, and IPS itself is known to suffer from high variance. Consequently, offline RL approaches that depend on IPS are ill-suited for our setting.\\n\\n## Advantage Weighted Supervised Fine Tuning\\n\\nGiven the three challenges outlined above, we propose a new algorithm Advantage-Weighted SFT (A-SFT). It leverages a combination of supervised fine-tuning and advantage reweighting from reinforcement learning. The key observation is as follows. Despite the reward estimation for each individual event having a high uncertainty, we find the estimations of rewards contain directional signals between high-reward and low-reward events. These signals could help better align the model during post-training.\\n\\nA central factor in this study is the generalization ability of the reward model. Better generalization enables more accurate predictions of user preferences for unseen titles, thereby making exploration more effective. For reward models with moderate to high generalization power, both online RL methods such as PPO and offline RL methods such as CQL can perform effectively. However, in our setting, reward model generalization is worse than the language counterparts’, which makes these algorithms less appropriate. In addition, the use of techniques like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) introduces a heightened risk of high-variance estimates, prompting us to exclude algorithms such as off-policy REINFORCE.\\n\\nOur proposed method A-SFT does not rely on IPS. With no need of prior knowledge of the logging policy, it can be generally applied to cases where observation of the environments are limited or biased. This is particularly useful to the recommendation setting due to the user feedback loop and distribution shifts with time. Without knowing the logging policy, A-SFT still provides means to control the policy deviation between the current policy and logging policy by tuning the parameter. This design provides essential means to control the learnt bias from uncertain reward models. We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1. Rejection Sampling Direct Preference Optimization / Identity Preference Optimization (RS DPO/IPO): this is a variant of DPO/IPO where, for each user history x, \\u200bwe generate contrasting response pairs by training an ensemble of reward models to estimate confidence intervals for the reward of multiple potential responses y. If the lower bound of the reward confidence interval for one response\\u200b is less than the upper bound for another response, then this pair is used to train DPO/IPO.\\n1. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL): This is a standard offline algorithm that learns a conservative Q function, penalizing overestimation of Q-values, particularly in regions of the state-action space with little or no reward data.\\n1. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): This is a standard RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) algorithm that uses reward models as an online environment. PPO learns an advantage function and optimizes the policy to maximize expected reward while maintaining proximity to the initial policy.\\n\\nWe sampled a separate test set of O(Millions) users. This test set is collected on a future date after the training.\\n\\n## Offline Evaluation Results\\n\\nWe evaluate our algorithm on a dataset of high-reward user trajectories. For sake of simplicity, we consider a trajectory to have a high reward if the accumulated reward is higher than the median of the population. We present the following metrics for the held out test dataset:\\n\\n1. NDCG@k: This measures the ranking quality of the recommended items up to position k. It accounts for the position of relevant items in the recommendation list, assigning higher scores when relevant items appear higher in the ranking. The gain is discounted logarithmically at lower ranks, and the result is normalized by the ideal ranking (i.e., the best possible ordering of items).\\n1. HR@k: This measures the proportion of test cases in which the ground-truth chosen item y appears in the top k recommendations. It is a binary metric per test case (hit or miss) and is averaged over all test cases.\\n1. MRR: MRR evaluates the ranking quality by measuring the reciprocal of the rank at which the chosen item appears in the recommendation list. The metric is averaged across all test cases.\\n1. Reward Model as A Judge: We use the reward model to evaluate the policy for future user events. We propose to use an ensemble of reward models for the evaluation to increase confidence. The result is based on the discounted reward generated for a few steps. The standard deviation is less than 4%.\\n\\nWe measure the percentage improvement in each metric compared to the baseline, Reward Weighted Behavior Cloning(BC). We notice that advantage weighted SFT shows the largest improvement in metrics, outweighing BC as well as reward model dependent algorithms like CQL, PPO, DPO and IPO.\\n\\nOur experiments show that advantage weighted SFT is a simple but promising approach for post-training generative recommenders as it deals with the issue of poor reward model generalizations and lack of IPS. More specifically, we find PPO, IPO and DPO achieve a good reward score, but also causes the overfitting from the reward model. Conservative Q-Learning achieves more robust improvements but does not fully capture the potential signals in the reward modeling.

Check outpart 1andpart 2to learn more.\\n\\nPicture this: It’s seconds before the biggest fight night in Netflix history. Sixty-five million fans are waiting, devices in hand, hearts pounding. The countdown hits zero. What does it take to get everyone to the action on time, every time? At Netflix, we’re used to on-demand viewing where everyone chooses their own moment. But with live events, millions are eager to join in at once. Our job: make sure our members never miss a beat.\\n\\nWhen Live events break streaming records¹²³, our infrastructure faces the ultimate stress test. Here’s how we engineered a discovery experience for a global audience excited to see a knockout.\\n\\n## Why are Live Events Different?\\n\\nUnlike Video on Demand (VOD), members want to catch live events as they happen. There’s something uniquely exciting about being part of the moment. That means we only have a brief window to recommend a Live event at just the right time. Too early, excitement fades; too late, the moment is missed. Every second counts.\\n\\nTo capture that excitement, we enhanced our recommendation delivery systems to serve real-time suggestions, providing members richer and more compelling signals to hit play in the moment when it matters most. The challenge? Sending dynamic, timely updates concurrently to over a hundred million devices worldwide without creating athundering herd effectthat would overwhelm our cloud services. Simply scaling up linearly isn’t efficient and reliable. For popular events, it could also divert resources from other critical services. We needed a smarter and more scalable solution than just adding more resources.\\n\\n## Orchestrating the moment: Real-time Recommendations\\n\\nWith millions of devices online and live event schedules that can shift in real time, the challenge was to keep everyone perfectly in sync. We set out to solve this by building a system that doesn’t just react, but adapts by dynamically updating recommendations as the event unfolds. We identified the need to balance three constraints:\\n\\n* Time: the duration required to coordinate an update.\\n* Request throughput:the capacity of our cloud services to handle requests.\\n* Compute cardinality: the variety of requests necessary to serve a unique update.\\n\\nWe solved this constraint optimization problem by splitting the real-time recommendations into two phases:prefetchingandreal-time broadcasting. First, we prefetch the necessary data ahead of time, distributing the load over a longer period to avoid traffic spikes. When the Live event starts or ends, we broadcast a low cardinality message to all connected devices, prompting them to use the prefetched data locally. The timing of the broadcast also adapts when event times shift to preserve accuracy with the production of the Live event. By combining these two phases, we’re able to keep our members’ devices in sync and solve the thundering herd problem. To maximize device reach, especially for those with unstable networks, we use “at least once” broadcasts to ensure every device gets the latest updates and can catch up on any previously missed broadcasts as soon as they’re back online.\\n\\nThe first phase optimizesrequest throughputandcompute cardinalityby prefetching materialized recommendations, displayed title metadata, and artwork for a Live event. As members naturally browse their devices before the event, this data is prepopulated and stored locally in device cache, awaiting the notification trigger to serve the recommendations instantaneously. By distributing these requests naturally over time ahead of the event, we can eliminate any related traffic spikes and avoid the need for large-scale, real-time system scaling.\\n\\nThe second phase optimizesrequest throughputandtimeto updatedevices by broadcasting a low-cardinality, real-time message to all connected devices at critical moments in a Live event’s lifecycle. Each broadcast payload includes astate keyand atimestamp. The state key indicates the current stage of the Live event, allowing devices to use their pre-fetched data to update cached responses locally without additional server requests. The timestamp ensures that if a device misses a broadcast due to network issues, it can catch up by replaying missed updates upon reconnecting. This mechanism guarantees devices receive updates at least once, significantly increasing delivery reliability even on unstable networks.\\n\\n> Moment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\nMoment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\n## Under the Hood: How It Works\\n\\nWith the big picture in mind, let’s examine how these pieces interact in practice.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\nIn the diagram below, the Message Producer microservice centralizes all of the business logic. It continuously monitors live events for setup and timing changes. When it detects an update, it schedules broadcasts to be sent at precisely the right moment. The Message Producer also standardizes communication by providing a concise GraphQL schema for both device queries and broadcast payloads.\\n\\nRather than sending broadcasts directly to devices via WebSocket, the Message Producer hands them off to the Message Router. The Message Router is part of a robust two-tier pub/sub architecture built on proven technologies likePushy(our WebSocket proxy), Apache Kafka, andNetflix’s KV key-value store. The Message Router tracks subscriptions at the Pushy node granularity, while Pushy nodes map the subscriptions to individual connections, creating a low-latency fanout that minimizes compute and bandwidth requirements.\\n\\nDevices interface with our GraphQLDomain Graph Service (DGS). These schemas offer multiple query interfaces for prefetching, allowing devices to tailor their requests to the specific experience being presented. Each response adheres to a consistent API that resolves to a map of stage keys, enabling fast lookups and keeping business logic off the device. Our broadcast schema specifies WebSocket connection parameters, the current event stage, and the timestamp of the last broadcast message. When a device receives a broadcast, it injects the payload directly into its cache, triggering an immediate update and re-render of the interface.\\n\\n## Balancing the Moment: Throughput Management\\n\\nIn addition to building the new technology to support real-time recommendations, we also evaluated our existing systems for potential traffic hotspots. Using high-watermark traffic projections for live events, we generated synthetic traffic to simulate game-day scenarios and observed how our online services handled these bursts. Through this process, several common patterns emerged:\\n\\nBreaking the Cache Synchrony\\n\\nOur game-day simulations revealed that while our approach mitigated the immediate thundering herd risks driven by member traffic during the events, live events introduced unexpected mini thundering herds in our systems hours before and after the actual events. The surge of members joining just in time for these events led to concentrated cache expirations and recomputations, which created traffic spikes well outside the event window that we did not anticipate. This was not a problem for VOD content because the member traffic patterns are a lot smoother. We found that fixed TTLs caused cache expirations and refresh-traffic spikes to happen all at once. To address this, we added jitter to server and client cache expirations to spread out refreshes and smooth out traffic spikes.\\n\\nAdaptive Traffic Prioritization\\n\\nWhile our services already leverage traffic prioritization and partitioning based on factors such as request type and device type, live events introduced a distinct challenge. These events generated brief traffic bursts that were intensely spiky and placed significant strain on our systems. Through simulations, we recognized the need for an additional event-driven layer of traffic management.\\n\\nTo tackle this, we improved our traffic sharding strategies by using event-based signals. This enabled us to route live event traffic to dedicated clusters with more aggressive scaling policies. We also added a dynamic traffic prioritization ruleset that activates whenever we see high requests per second (RPS) to ensure our systems can handle the surge smoothly. During these peaks, we aggressively deprioritize non-critical server-driven updates so that our systems can devote resources to the most time-sensitive computations. This approach ensures smooth performance and reliability when demand is at its highest.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nWhen we set out to build a seamlessly scalable scheduled viewing experience, our goal was to create a dynamic and richer member experience for live content. Popular live events like the Crawford v. Canelo fight and the NFL Christmas games truly put our systems to the test. Along the way, we also uncovered valuable learnings that continue to shape our work. Our attempts to deprioritize traffic to other non-critical services caused unexpected call patterns and spikes in traffic elsewhere. Similarly, in hindsight, we also learned that the high traffic volume from popular events caused excessive non-essential logging and was putting unnecessary pressure on our ingestion pipelines.\\n\\nNone of this work would have been possible without our stunning colleagues at Netflix who collaborated across multiple functions to architect, build, and test these approaches, ensuring members can easily access events at the right moment: UI Engineering, Cloud Gateway, Data Science & Engineering, Search and Discovery, Evidence Engineering, Member Experience Foundations, Content Promotion and Distribution, Operations and Reliability, Device Playback, Experience and Design and Product Management.\\n\\nAs Netflix’s content offering expands to include new formats like live titles, free-to-air linear content, and games, we’re excited to build on what we’ve accomplished and look ahead to even more possibilities. Our roadmap includes extending the capabilities we developed for scheduled live viewing to these emerging formats. We’re also focused on enhancing our engineering tooling for greater visibility into operations, message delivery, and error handling to help us continue to deliver the best possible experience for our members.\\n\\n## Join Us for What’s Next\\n\\nWe’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible as we bring new live experiences to members around the world.

Generative recommenders (GRs) represent a new paradigm in the field of recommendation systems (e.g.HSTU,OneRec). These models draw inspiration from recent advancements in transformer architectures used for language and vision tasks. They approach the recommendation problem, including both ranking and retrieval, as a sequential transduction task. This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens. The reward model uses an open-sourced HSTU architecture in the convenience of reproducing this study. We adopt the standard RLHF approach of training a reward model using offline, human-collected feedback. We start by creating a proxy reward, scored on a scale from 1 to 5 in the convenience of understanding. This reward model is co-trained as a shallow reward head on top of the generative recommender. It predicts the reward for the most recently selected title based on a user’s interaction history. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare the model’s performance against two simple baselines: (1) predicting the next reward as the average reward the user has given in their past interactions, and (2) predicting it as the average reward that all users have assigned to that particular title in previous interactions.\\n\\nTable 1: Reward model performance metrics\\n\\nWe observe that the model’s predictions do not significantly outperform the simple baselines. This result is intuitive, as a user’s historical interactions typically cover only a small subset of titles, making it difficult to accurately predict their responses to the vast number of unexplored titles in the catalogue. We expect this to be a potential issue for any large recommendation systems where the ratio between explored and unexplored titles is very small.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\n3. Lack of Logged Policy\\n\\nIn recommendation systems, the policy that generated the logged data is typically unknown and cannot be directly estimated. Offline reinforcement learning methods often rely on Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to debias such data by reweighting interactions according to the logging policy’s action probabilities. However, estimating the logging policy accurately is challenging and prone to error, which can introduce additional biases, and IPS itself is known to suffer from high variance. Consequently, offline RL approaches that depend on IPS are ill-suited for our setting.\\n\\n## Advantage Weighted Supervised Fine Tuning\\n\\nGiven the three challenges outlined above, we propose a new algorithm Advantage-Weighted SFT (A-SFT). It leverages a combination of supervised fine-tuning and advantage reweighting from reinforcement learning. The key observation is as follows. Despite the reward estimation for each individual event having a high uncertainty, we find the estimations of rewards contain directional signals between high-reward and low-reward events. These signals could help better align the model during post-training.\\n\\nA central factor in this study is the generalization ability of the reward model. Better generalization enables more accurate predictions of user preferences for unseen titles, thereby making exploration more effective. For reward models with moderate to high generalization power, both online RL methods such as PPO and offline RL methods such as CQL can perform effectively. However, in our setting, reward model generalization is worse than the language counterparts’, which makes these algorithms less appropriate. In addition, the use of techniques like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) introduces a heightened risk of high-variance estimates, prompting us to exclude algorithms such as off-policy REINFORCE.\\n\\nOur proposed method A-SFT does not rely on IPS. With no need of prior knowledge of the logging policy, it can be generally applied to cases where observation of the environments are limited or biased. This is particularly useful to the recommendation setting due to the user feedback loop and distribution shifts with time. Without knowing the logging policy, A-SFT still provides means to control the policy deviation between the current policy and logging policy by tuning the parameter. This design provides essential means to control the learnt bias from uncertain reward models. We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1. Rejection Sampling Direct Preference Optimization / Identity Preference Optimization (RS DPO/IPO): this is a variant of DPO/IPO where, for each user history x, \\u200bwe generate contrasting response pairs by training an ensemble of reward models to estimate confidence intervals for the reward of multiple potential responses y. If the lower bound of the reward confidence interval for one response\\u200b is less than the upper bound for another response, then this pair is used to train DPO/IPO.\\n1. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL): This is a standard offline algorithm that learns a conservative Q function, penalizing overestimation of Q-values, particularly in regions of the state-action space with little or no reward data.\\n1. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): This is a standard RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) algorithm that uses reward models as an online environment. PPO learns an advantage function and optimizes the policy to maximize expected reward while maintaining proximity to the initial policy.\\n\\nWe sampled a separate test set of O(Millions) users. This test set is collected on a future date after the training.\\n\\n## Offline Evaluation Results\\n\\nWe evaluate our algorithm on a dataset of high-reward user trajectories. For sake of simplicity, we consider a trajectory to have a high reward if the accumulated reward is higher than the median of the population. We present the following metrics for the held out test dataset:\\n\\n1. NDCG@k: This measures the ranking quality of the recommended items up to position k. It accounts for the position of relevant items in the recommendation list, assigning higher scores when relevant items appear higher in the ranking. The gain is discounted logarithmically at lower ranks, and the result is normalized by the ideal ranking (i.e., the best possible ordering of items).\\n1. HR@k: This measures the proportion of test cases in which the ground-truth chosen item y appears in the top k recommendations. It is a binary metric per test case (hit or miss) and is averaged over all test cases.\\n1. MRR: MRR evaluates the ranking quality by measuring the reciprocal of the rank at which the chosen item appears in the recommendation list. The metric is averaged across all test cases.\\n1. Reward Model as A Judge: We use the reward model to evaluate the policy for future user events. We propose to use an ensemble of reward models for the evaluation to increase confidence. The result is based on the discounted reward generated for a few steps. The standard deviation is less than 4%.\\n\\nWe measure the percentage improvement in each metric compared to the baseline, Reward Weighted Behavior Cloning(BC). We notice that advantage weighted SFT shows the largest improvement in metrics, outweighing BC as well as reward model dependent algorithms like CQL, PPO, DPO and IPO.\\n\\nOur experiments show that advantage weighted SFT is a simple but promising approach for post-training generative recommenders as it deals with the issue of poor reward model generalizations and lack of IPS. More specifically, we find PPO, IPO and DPO achieve a good reward score, but also causes the overfitting from the reward model. Conservative Q-Learning achieves more robust improvements but does not fully capture the potential signals in the reward modeling.

Generative recommenders (GRs) represent a new paradigm in the field of recommendation systems (e.g.HSTU,OneRec). These models draw inspiration from recent advancements in transformer architectures used for language and vision tasks. They approach the recommendation problem, including both ranking and retrieval, as a sequential transduction task. This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens.

Check outpart 1andpart 2to learn more.\\n\\nPicture this: It’s seconds before the biggest fight night in Netflix history. Sixty-five million fans are waiting, devices in hand, hearts pounding. The countdown hits zero. What does it take to get everyone to the action on time, every time? At Netflix, we’re used to on-demand viewing where everyone chooses their own moment. But with live events, millions are eager to join in at once. Our job: make sure our members never miss a beat.\\n\\nWhen Live events break streaming records¹²³, our infrastructure faces the ultimate stress test. Here’s how we engineered a discovery experience for a global audience excited to see a knockout.\\n\\n## Why are Live Events Different?\\n\\nUnlike Video on Demand (VOD), members want to catch live events as they happen. There’s something uniquely exciting about being part of the moment. That means we only have a brief window to recommend a Live event at just the right time. Too early, excitement fades; too late, the moment is missed. Every second counts.\\n\\nTo capture that excitement, we enhanced our recommendation delivery systems to serve real-time suggestions, providing members richer and more compelling signals to hit play in the moment when it matters most. The challenge? Sending dynamic, timely updates concurrently to over a hundred million devices worldwide without creating athundering herd effectthat would overwhelm our cloud services. Simply scaling up linearly isn’t efficient and reliable. For popular events, it could also divert resources from other critical services. We needed a smarter and more scalable solution than just adding more resources.\\n\\n## Orchestrating the moment: Real-time Recommendations\\n\\nWith millions of devices online and live event schedules that can shift in real time, the challenge was to keep everyone perfectly in sync. We set out to solve this by building a system that doesn’t just react, but adapts by dynamically updating recommendations as the event unfolds. We identified the need to balance three constraints:\\n\\n* Time: the duration required to coordinate an update.\\n* Request throughput:the capacity of our cloud services to handle requests.\\n* Compute cardinality: the variety of requests necessary to serve a unique update.\\n\\nWe solved this constraint optimization problem by splitting the real-time recommendations into two phases:prefetchingandreal-time broadcasting. First, we prefetch the necessary data ahead of time, distributing the load over a longer period to avoid traffic spikes. When the Live event starts or ends, we broadcast a low cardinality message to all connected devices, prompting them to use the prefetched data locally. The timing of the broadcast also adapts when event times shift to preserve accuracy with the production of the Live event. By combining these two phases, we’re able to keep our members’ devices in sync and solve the thundering herd problem. To maximize device reach, especially for those with unstable networks, we use “at least once” broadcasts to ensure every device gets the latest updates and can catch up on any previously missed broadcasts as soon as they’re back online.\\n\\nThe first phase optimizesrequest throughputandcompute cardinalityby prefetching materialized recommendations, displayed title metadata, and artwork for a Live event. As members naturally browse their devices before the event, this data is prepopulated and stored locally in device cache, awaiting the notification trigger to serve the recommendations instantaneously. By distributing these requests naturally over time ahead of the event, we can eliminate any related traffic spikes and avoid the need for large-scale, real-time system scaling.\\n\\nThe second phase optimizesrequest throughputandtimeto updatedevices by broadcasting a low-cardinality, real-time message to all connected devices at critical moments in a Live event’s lifecycle. Each broadcast payload includes astate keyand atimestamp. The state key indicates the current stage of the Live event, allowing devices to use their pre-fetched data to update cached responses locally without additional server requests. The timestamp ensures that if a device misses a broadcast due to network issues, it can catch up by replaying missed updates upon reconnecting. This mechanism guarantees devices receive updates at least once, significantly increasing delivery reliability even on unstable networks.\\n\\n> Moment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\nMoment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\n## Under the Hood: How It Works\\n\\nWith the big picture in mind, let’s examine how these pieces interact in practice.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\nIn the diagram below, the Message Producer microservice centralizes all of the business logic. It continuously monitors live events for setup and timing changes. When it detects an update, it schedules broadcasts to be sent at precisely the right moment. The Message Producer also standardizes communication by providing a concise GraphQL schema for both device queries and broadcast payloads.\\n\\nRather than sending broadcasts directly to devices via WebSocket, the Message Producer hands them off to the Message Router. The Message Router is part of a robust two-tier pub/sub architecture built on proven technologies likePushy(our WebSocket proxy), Apache Kafka, andNetflix’s KV key-value store. The Message Router tracks subscriptions at the Pushy node granularity, while Pushy nodes map the subscriptions to individual connections, creating a low-latency fanout that minimizes compute and bandwidth requirements.\\n\\nDevices interface with our GraphQLDomain Graph Service (DGS). These schemas offer multiple query interfaces for prefetching, allowing devices to tailor their requests to the specific experience being presented. Each response adheres to a consistent API that resolves to a map of stage keys, enabling fast lookups and keeping business logic off the device. Our broadcast schema specifies WebSocket connection parameters, the current event stage, and the timestamp of the last broadcast message. When a device receives a broadcast, it injects the payload directly into its cache, triggering an immediate update and re-render of the interface.\\n\\n## Balancing the Moment: Throughput Management\\n\\nIn addition to building the new technology to support real-time recommendations, we also evaluated our existing systems for potential traffic hotspots. Using high-watermark traffic projections for live events, we generated synthetic traffic to simulate game-day scenarios and observed how our online services handled these bursts. Through this process, several common patterns emerged:\\n\\nBreaking the Cache Synchrony\\n\\nOur game-day simulations revealed that while our approach mitigated the immediate thundering herd risks driven by member traffic during the events, live events introduced unexpected mini thundering herds in our systems hours before and after the actual events. The surge of members joining just in time for these events led to concentrated cache expirations and recomputations, which created traffic spikes well outside the event window that we did not anticipate. This was not a problem for VOD content because the member traffic patterns are a lot smoother. We found that fixed TTLs caused cache expirations and refresh-traffic spikes to happen all at once. To address this, we added jitter to server and client cache expirations to spread out refreshes and smooth out traffic spikes.\\n\\nAdaptive Traffic Prioritization\\n\\nWhile our services already leverage traffic prioritization and partitioning based on factors such as request type and device type, live events introduced a distinct challenge. These events generated brief traffic bursts that were intensely spiky and placed significant strain on our systems. Through simulations, we recognized the need for an additional event-driven layer of traffic management.\\n\\nTo tackle this, we improved our traffic sharding strategies by using event-based signals. This enabled us to route live event traffic to dedicated clusters with more aggressive scaling policies. We also added a dynamic traffic prioritization ruleset that activates whenever we see high requests per second (RPS) to ensure our systems can handle the surge smoothly. During these peaks, we aggressively deprioritize non-critical server-driven updates so that our systems can devote resources to the most time-sensitive computations. This approach ensures smooth performance and reliability when demand is at its highest.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nWhen we set out to build a seamlessly scalable scheduled viewing experience, our goal was to create a dynamic and richer member experience for live content. Popular live events like the Crawford v. Canelo fight and the NFL Christmas games truly put our systems to the test. Along the way, we also uncovered valuable learnings that continue to shape our work. Our attempts to deprioritize traffic to other non-critical services caused unexpected call patterns and spikes in traffic elsewhere. Similarly, in hindsight, we also learned that the high traffic volume from popular events caused excessive non-essential logging and was putting unnecessary pressure on our ingestion pipelines.\\n\\nNone of this work would have been possible without our stunning colleagues at Netflix who collaborated across multiple functions to architect, build, and test these approaches, ensuring members can easily access events at the right moment: UI Engineering, Cloud Gateway, Data Science & Engineering, Search and Discovery, Evidence Engineering, Member Experience Foundations, Content Promotion and Distribution, Operations and Reliability, Device Playback, Experience and Design and Product Management.\\n\\nAs Netflix’s content offering expands to include new formats like live titles, free-to-air linear content, and games, we’re excited to build on what we’ve accomplished and look ahead to even more possibilities. Our roadmap includes extending the capabilities we developed for scheduled live viewing to these emerging formats. We’re also focused on enhancing our engineering tooling for greater visibility into operations, message delivery, and error handling to help us continue to deliver the best possible experience for our members.\\n\\n## Join Us for What’s Next\\n\\nWe’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible as we bring new live experiences to members around the world.

Generative recommenders (GRs) represent a new paradigm in the field of recommendation systems (e.g.HSTU,OneRec). These models draw inspiration from recent advancements in transformer architectures used for language and vision tasks. They approach the recommendation problem, including both ranking and retrieval, as a sequential transduction task. This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens. The reward model uses an open-sourced HSTU architecture in the convenience of reproducing this study. We adopt the standard RLHF approach of training a reward model using offline, human-collected feedback. We start by creating a proxy reward, scored on a scale from 1 to 5 in the convenience of understanding. This reward model is co-trained as a shallow reward head on top of the generative recommender. It predicts the reward for the most recently selected title based on a user’s interaction history. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare the model’s performance against two simple baselines: (1) predicting the next reward as the average reward the user has given in their past interactions, and (2) predicting it as the average reward that all users have assigned to that particular title in previous interactions.\\n\\nTable 1: Reward model performance metrics\\n\\nWe observe that the model’s predictions do not significantly outperform the simple baselines. This result is intuitive, as a user’s historical interactions typically cover only a small subset of titles, making it difficult to accurately predict their responses to the vast number of unexplored titles in the catalogue. We expect this to be a potential issue for any large recommendation systems where the ratio between explored and unexplored titles is very small.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\n3. Lack of Logged Policy\\n\\nIn recommendation systems, the policy that generated the logged data is typically unknown and cannot be directly estimated. Offline reinforcement learning methods often rely on Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to debias such data by reweighting interactions according to the logging policy’s action probabilities. However, estimating the logging policy accurately is challenging and prone to error, which can introduce additional biases, and IPS itself is known to suffer from high variance. Consequently, offline RL approaches that depend on IPS are ill-suited for our setting.\\n\\n## Advantage Weighted Supervised Fine Tuning\\n\\nGiven the three challenges outlined above, we propose a new algorithm Advantage-Weighted SFT (A-SFT). It leverages a combination of supervised fine-tuning and advantage reweighting from reinforcement learning. The key observation is as follows. Despite the reward estimation for each individual event having a high uncertainty, we find the estimations of rewards contain directional signals between high-reward and low-reward events. These signals could help better align the model during post-training.\\n\\nA central factor in this study is the generalization ability of the reward model. Better generalization enables more accurate predictions of user preferences for unseen titles, thereby making exploration more effective. For reward models with moderate to high generalization power, both online RL methods such as PPO and offline RL methods such as CQL can perform effectively. However, in our setting, reward model generalization is worse than the language counterparts’, which makes these algorithms less appropriate. In addition, the use of techniques like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) introduces a heightened risk of high-variance estimates, prompting us to exclude algorithms such as off-policy REINFORCE.\\n\\nOur proposed method A-SFT does not rely on IPS. With no need of prior knowledge of the logging policy, it can be generally applied to cases where observation of the environments are limited or biased. This is particularly useful to the recommendation setting due to the user feedback loop and distribution shifts with time. Without knowing the logging policy, A-SFT still provides means to control the policy deviation between the current policy and logging policy by tuning the parameter. This design provides essential means to control the learnt bias from uncertain reward models. We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1. Rejection Sampling Direct Preference Optimization / Identity Preference Optimization (RS DPO/IPO): this is a variant of DPO/IPO where, for each user history x, \\u200bwe generate contrasting response pairs by training an ensemble of reward models to estimate confidence intervals for the reward of multiple potential responses y. If the lower bound of the reward confidence interval for one response\\u200b is less than the upper bound for another response, then this pair is used to train DPO/IPO.\\n1. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL): This is a standard offline algorithm that learns a conservative Q function, penalizing overestimation of Q-values, particularly in regions of the state-action space with little or no reward data.\\n1. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): This is a standard RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) algorithm that uses reward models as an online environment. PPO learns an advantage function and optimizes the policy to maximize expected reward while maintaining proximity to the initial policy.\\n\\nWe sampled a separate test set of O(Millions) users. This test set is collected on a future date after the training.\\n\\n## Offline Evaluation Results\\n\\nWe evaluate our algorithm on a dataset of high-reward user trajectories. For sake of simplicity, we consider a trajectory to have a high reward if the accumulated reward is higher than the median of the population. We present the following metrics for the held out test dataset:\\n\\n1. NDCG@k: This measures the ranking quality of the recommended items up to position k. It accounts for the position of relevant items in the recommendation list, assigning higher scores when relevant items appear higher in the ranking. The gain is discounted logarithmically at lower ranks, and the result is normalized by the ideal ranking (i.e., the best possible ordering of items).\\n1. HR@k: This measures the proportion of test cases in which the ground-truth chosen item y appears in the top k recommendations. It is a binary metric per test case (hit or miss) and is averaged over all test cases.\\n1. MRR: MRR evaluates the ranking quality by measuring the reciprocal of the rank at which the chosen item appears in the recommendation list. The metric is averaged across all test cases.\\n1. Reward Model as A Judge: We use the reward model to evaluate the policy for future user events. We propose to use an ensemble of reward models for the evaluation to increase confidence. The result is based on the discounted reward generated for a few steps. The standard deviation is less than 4%.\\n\\nWe measure the percentage improvement in each metric compared to the baseline, Reward Weighted Behavior Cloning(BC). We notice that advantage weighted SFT shows the largest improvement in metrics, outweighing BC as well as reward model dependent algorithms like CQL, PPO, DPO and IPO.\\n\\nOur experiments show that advantage weighted SFT is a simple but promising approach for post-training generative recommenders as it deals with the issue of poor reward model generalizations and lack of IPS. More specifically, we find PPO, IPO and DPO achieve a good reward score, but also causes the overfitting from the reward model. Conservative Q-Learning achieves more robust improvements but does not fully capture the potential signals in the reward modeling. A-SFT achieved both better recommendation metrics and reward scores.', 'title': 'Post-Training Generative Recommenders with Advantage-Weighted Supervised Finetuning', 'url': 'https://netflixtechblog.com/post-training-generative-recommenders-with-advantage-weighted-supervised-finetuning-61a538d717a9?source=collection_home_page----2615bd06b42e-----0-----------------------------------'}, {'markdown': 'Author:Keertana Chidambaram,Qiuling Xu,Ko-Jen Hsiao,Moumita Bhattacharya\\n\\n(*The work was done when Keertana interned at Netflix.)\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThis blog focuses on post-training generative recommender systems.

This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens. The reward model uses an open-sourced HSTU architecture in the convenience of reproducing this study. We adopt the standard RLHF approach of training a reward model using offline, human-collected feedback. We start by creating a proxy reward, scored on a scale from 1 to 5 in the convenience of understanding. This reward model is co-trained as a shallow reward head on top of the generative recommender. It predicts the reward for the most recently selected title based on a user’s interaction history. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare the model’s performance against two simple baselines: (1) predicting the next reward as the average reward the user has given in their past interactions, and (2) predicting it as the average reward that all users have assigned to that particular title in previous interactions.\\n\\nTable 1: Reward model performance metrics\\n\\nWe observe that the model’s predictions do not significantly outperform the simple baselines. This result is intuitive, as a user’s historical interactions typically cover only a small subset of titles, making it difficult to accurately predict their responses to the vast number of unexplored titles in the catalogue. We expect this to be a potential issue for any large recommendation systems where the ratio between explored and unexplored titles is very small.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\n3. Lack of Logged Policy\\n\\nIn recommendation systems, the policy that generated the logged data is typically unknown and cannot be directly estimated. Offline reinforcement learning methods often rely on Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to debias such data by reweighting interactions according to the logging policy’s action probabilities. However, estimating the logging policy accurately is challenging and prone to error, which can introduce additional biases, and IPS itself is known to suffer from high variance. Consequently, offline RL approaches that depend on IPS are ill-suited for our setting.\\n\\n## Advantage Weighted Supervised Fine Tuning\\n\\nGiven the three challenges outlined above, we propose a new algorithm Advantage-Weighted SFT (A-SFT). It leverages a combination of supervised fine-tuning and advantage reweighting from reinforcement learning. The key observation is as follows. Despite the reward estimation for each individual event having a high uncertainty, we find the estimations of rewards contain directional signals between high-reward and low-reward events. These signals could help better align the model during post-training.\\n\\nA central factor in this study is the generalization ability of the reward model. Better generalization enables more accurate predictions of user preferences for unseen titles, thereby making exploration more effective. For reward models with moderate to high generalization power, both online RL methods such as PPO and offline RL methods such as CQL can perform effectively. However, in our setting, reward model generalization is worse than the language counterparts’, which makes these algorithms less appropriate. In addition, the use of techniques like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) introduces a heightened risk of high-variance estimates, prompting us to exclude algorithms such as off-policy REINFORCE.\\n\\nOur proposed method A-SFT does not rely on IPS. With no need of prior knowledge of the logging policy, it can be generally applied to cases where observation of the environments are limited or biased. This is particularly useful to the recommendation setting due to the user feedback loop and distribution shifts with time. Without knowing the logging policy, A-SFT still provides means to control the policy deviation between the current policy and logging policy by tuning the parameter. This design provides essential means to control the learnt bias from uncertain reward models. We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1. Rejection Sampling Direct Preference Optimization / Identity Preference Optimization (RS DPO/IPO): this is a variant of DPO/IPO where, for each user history x, \\u200bwe generate contrasting response pairs by training an ensemble of reward models to estimate confidence intervals for the reward of multiple potential responses y. If the lower bound of the reward confidence interval for one response\\u200b is less than the upper bound for another response, then this pair is used to train DPO/IPO.\\n1. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL): This is a standard offline algorithm that learns a conservative Q function, penalizing overestimation of Q-values, particularly in regions of the state-action space with little or no reward data.\\n1. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): This is a standard RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) algorithm that uses reward models as an online environment. PPO learns an advantage function and optimizes the policy to maximize expected reward while maintaining proximity to the initial policy.\\n\\nWe sampled a separate test set of O(Millions) users. This test set is collected on a future date after the training.\\n\\n## Offline Evaluation Results\\n\\nWe evaluate our algorithm on a dataset of high-reward user trajectories. For sake of simplicity, we consider a trajectory to have a high reward if the accumulated reward is higher than the median of the population. We present the following metrics for the held out test dataset:\\n\\n1. NDCG@k: This measures the ranking quality of the recommended items up to position k. It accounts for the position of relevant items in the recommendation list, assigning higher scores when relevant items appear higher in the ranking. The gain is discounted logarithmically at lower ranks, and the result is normalized by the ideal ranking (i.e., the best possible ordering of items).\\n1. HR@k: This measures the proportion of test cases in which the ground-truth chosen item y appears in the top k recommendations. It is a binary metric per test case (hit or miss) and is averaged over all test cases.\\n1. MRR: MRR evaluates the ranking quality by measuring the reciprocal of the rank at which the chosen item appears in the recommendation list. The metric is averaged across all test cases.\\n1. Reward Model as A Judge: We use the reward model to evaluate the policy for future user events. We propose to use an ensemble of reward models for the evaluation to increase confidence. The result is based on the discounted reward generated for a few steps. The standard deviation is less than 4%.\\n\\nWe measure the percentage improvement in each metric compared to the baseline, Reward Weighted Behavior Cloning(BC). We notice that advantage weighted SFT shows the largest improvement in metrics, outweighing BC as well as reward model dependent algorithms like CQL, PPO, DPO and IPO.\\n\\nOur experiments show that advantage weighted SFT is a simple but promising approach for post-training generative recommenders as it deals with the issue of poor reward model generalizations and lack of IPS. More specifically, we find PPO, IPO and DPO achieve a good reward score, but also causes the overfitting from the reward model. Conservative Q-Learning achieves more robust improvements but does not fully capture the potential signals in the reward modeling. A-SFT achieved both better recommendation metrics and reward scores.', 'title': 'Post-Training Generative Recommenders with Advantage-Weighted Supervised Finetuning', 'url': 'https://netflixtechblog.com/post-training-generative-recommenders-with-advantage-weighted-supervised-finetuning-61a538d717a9?source=collection_home_page----2615bd06b42e-----0-----------------------------------'}, {'markdown': 'By:Kris Range,Ankush Gulati,Jim Isaacs,Jennifer Shin,Jeremy Kelly,Jason Tu\\n\\nThis is part 3 in a series called “Behind the Streams”. Check outpart 1andpart 2to learn more.\\n\\nPicture this: It’s seconds before the biggest fight night in Netflix history. Sixty-five million fans are waiting, devices in hand, hearts pounding. The countdown hits zero. What does it take to get everyone to the action on time, every time? At Netflix, we’re used to on-demand viewing where everyone chooses their own moment. But with live events, millions are eager to join in at once. Our job: make sure our members never miss a beat.\\n\\nWhen Live events break streaming records¹²³, our infrastructure faces the ultimate stress test. Here’s how we engineered a discovery experience for a global audience excited to see a knockout.\\n\\n## Why are Live Events Different?\\n\\nUnlike Video on Demand (VOD), members want to catch live events as they happen. There’s something uniquely exciting about being part of the moment. That means we only have a brief window to recommend a Live event at just the right time. Too early, excitement fades; too late, the moment is missed. Every second counts.\\n\\nTo capture that excitement, we enhanced our recommendation delivery systems to serve real-time suggestions, providing members richer and more compelling signals to hit play in the moment when it matters most. The challenge? Sending dynamic, timely updates concurrently to over a hundred million devices worldwide without creating athundering herd effectthat would overwhelm our cloud services. Simply scaling up linearly isn’t efficient and reliable. For popular events, it could also divert resources from other critical services. We needed a smarter and more scalable solution than just adding more resources.\\n\\n## Orchestrating the moment: Real-time Recommendations\\n\\nWith millions of devices online and live event schedules that can shift in real time, the challenge was to keep everyone perfectly in sync. We set out to solve this by building a system that doesn’t just react, but adapts by dynamically updating recommendations as the event unfolds. We identified the need to balance three constraints:\\n\\n* Time: the duration required to coordinate an update.\\n* Request throughput:the capacity of our cloud services to handle requests.\\n* Compute cardinality: the variety of requests necessary to serve a unique update.\\n\\nWe solved this constraint optimization problem by splitting the real-time recommendations into two phases:prefetchingandreal-time broadcasting. First, we prefetch the necessary data ahead of time, distributing the load over a longer period to avoid traffic spikes. When the Live event starts or ends, we broadcast a low cardinality message to all connected devices, prompting them to use the prefetched data locally. The timing of the broadcast also adapts when event times shift to preserve accuracy with the production of the Live event. By combining these two phases, we’re able to keep our members’ devices in sync and solve the thundering herd problem. To maximize device reach, especially for those with unstable networks, we use “at least once” broadcasts to ensure every device gets the latest updates and can catch up on any previously missed broadcasts as soon as they’re back online.\\n\\nThe first phase optimizesrequest throughputandcompute cardinalityby prefetching materialized recommendations, displayed title metadata, and artwork for a Live event. As members naturally browse their devices before the event, this data is prepopulated and stored locally in device cache, awaiting the notification trigger to serve the recommendations instantaneously. By distributing these requests naturally over time ahead of the event, we can eliminate any related traffic spikes and avoid the need for large-scale, real-time system scaling.\\n\\nThe second phase optimizesrequest throughputandtimeto updatedevices by broadcasting a low-cardinality, real-time message to all connected devices at critical moments in a Live event’s lifecycle. Each broadcast payload includes astate keyand atimestamp. The state key indicates the current stage of the Live event, allowing devices to use their pre-fetched data to update cached responses locally without additional server requests. The timestamp ensures that if a device misses a broadcast due to network issues, it can catch up by replaying missed updates upon reconnecting. This mechanism guarantees devices receive updates at least once, significantly increasing delivery reliability even on unstable networks.\\n\\n> Moment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\nMoment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\n## Under the Hood: How It Works\\n\\nWith the big picture in mind, let’s examine how these pieces interact in practice.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\nIn the diagram below, the Message Producer microservice centralizes all of the business logic. It continuously monitors live events for setup and timing changes. When it detects an update, it schedules broadcasts to be sent at precisely the right moment. The Message Producer also standardizes communication by providing a concise GraphQL schema for both device queries and broadcast payloads.\\n\\nRather than sending broadcasts directly to devices via WebSocket, the Message Producer hands them off to the Message Router. The Message Router is part of a robust two-tier pub/sub architecture built on proven technologies likePushy(our WebSocket proxy), Apache Kafka, andNetflix’s KV key-value store. The Message Router tracks subscriptions at the Pushy node granularity, while Pushy nodes map the subscriptions to individual connections, creating a low-latency fanout that minimizes compute and bandwidth requirements.\\n\\nDevices interface with our GraphQLDomain Graph Service (DGS). These schemas offer multiple query interfaces for prefetching, allowing devices to tailor their requests to the specific experience being presented. Each response adheres to a consistent API that resolves to a map of stage keys, enabling fast lookups and keeping business logic off the device. Our broadcast schema specifies WebSocket connection parameters, the current event stage, and the timestamp of the last broadcast message. When a device receives a broadcast, it injects the payload directly into its cache, triggering an immediate update and re-render of the interface.\\n\\n## Balancing the Moment: Throughput Management\\n\\nIn addition to building the new technology to support real-time recommendations, we also evaluated our existing systems for potential traffic hotspots. Using high-watermark traffic projections for live events, we generated synthetic traffic to simulate game-day scenarios and observed how our online services handled these bursts. Through this process, several common patterns emerged:\\n\\nBreaking the Cache Synchrony\\n\\nOur game-day simulations revealed that while our approach mitigated the immediate thundering herd risks driven by member traffic during the events, live events introduced unexpected mini thundering herds in our systems hours before and after the actual events. The surge of members joining just in time for these events led to concentrated cache expirations and recomputations, which created traffic spikes well outside the event window that we did not anticipate. This was not a problem for VOD content because the member traffic patterns are a lot smoother. We found that fixed TTLs caused cache expirations and refresh-traffic spikes to happen all at once. To address this, we added jitter to server and client cache expirations to spread out refreshes and smooth out traffic spikes.\\n\\nAdaptive Traffic Prioritization\\n\\nWhile our services already leverage traffic prioritization and partitioning based on factors such as request type and device type, live events introduced a distinct challenge. These events generated brief traffic bursts that were intensely spiky and placed significant strain on our systems. Through simulations, we recognized the need for an additional event-driven layer of traffic management.\\n\\nTo tackle this, we improved our traffic sharding strategies by using event-based signals. This enabled us to route live event traffic to dedicated clusters with more aggressive scaling policies. We also added a dynamic traffic prioritization ruleset that activates whenever we see high requests per second (RPS) to ensure our systems can handle the surge smoothly. During these peaks, we aggressively deprioritize non-critical server-driven updates so that our systems can devote resources to the most time-sensitive computations. This approach ensures smooth performance and reliability when demand is at its highest.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nWhen we set out to build a seamlessly scalable scheduled viewing experience, our goal was to create a dynamic and richer member experience for live content. Popular live events like the Crawford v. Canelo fight and the NFL Christmas games truly put our systems to the test. Along the way, we also uncovered valuable learnings that continue to shape our work. Our attempts to deprioritize traffic to other non-critical services caused unexpected call patterns and spikes in traffic elsewhere. Similarly, in hindsight, we also learned that the high traffic volume from popular events caused excessive non-essential logging and was putting unnecessary pressure on our ingestion pipelines.\\n\\nNone of this work would have been possible without our stunning colleagues at Netflix who collaborated across multiple functions to architect, build, and test these approaches, ensuring members can easily access events at the right moment: UI Engineering, Cloud Gateway, Data Science & Engineering, Search and Discovery, Evidence Engineering, Member Experience Foundations, Content Promotion and Distribution, Operations and Reliability, Device Playback, Experience and Design and Product Management.\\n\\nAs Netflix’s content offering expands to include new formats like live titles, free-to-air linear content, and games, we’re excited to build on what we’ve accomplished and look ahead to even more possibilities. Our roadmap includes extending the capabilities we developed for scheduled live viewing to these emerging formats. We’re also focused on enhancing our engineering tooling for greater visibility into operations, message delivery, and error handling to help us continue to deliver the best possible experience for our members.\\n\\n## Join Us for What’s Next\\n\\nWe’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible as we bring new live experiences to members around the world.

Gemini 2.5 Flash Image now ready for production with new aspect ratios\\n\\n* Facebook\\n* Twitter\\n* LinkedIn\\n* Mail\\n\\nOur state-of-the-art image generation and editing model which has captured the imagination of the world, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image 🍌, is now generally available, ready for production environments, and comes with new features like a wider range of aspect ratios in addition to being able to specify image-only output.\\n\\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image empowers users to seamlessly blend multiple images, maintain consistent characters for richer storytelling, perform targeted edits with natural language, and leverage Gemini\\'s extensive world knowledge for image generation and modification. The model is accessible through theGemini APIonGoogle AI Studioand onVertex AIfor enterprise use.\\n\\nFurther expanding creative possibilities, the model now supports 10 different aspect ratios. This allows for effortless content creation across various formats, from cinematic landscapes to vertical social media posts.\\n\\nSupported ratios include:\\n\\n* Landscape: 21:9, 16:9, 4:3, 3:2\\n* Square: 1:1\\n* Portrait: 9:16, 3:4, 2:3\\n* Flexible: 5:4, 4:5\\n\\n## What people are building\\n\\nCartwheelis harnessing AI to move beyond the \"slot machine user experience\" of many image generators, giving artists direct control to bring their creative vision to life. After months of building their \"Pose Mode\" feature and finding that other models failed to deliver, the team found a solution in the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. By combining Cartwheel\\'s 3D posing tool with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, they have created a powerful new image creation system that delivers unparalleled character control and consistency.\\n\\n“Other models couldn\\'t render characters from arbitrary camera angles or maintain faithfulness to a pose without sacrificing \"world knowledge\". The new Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model was the first that could provide both.” -Andrew Carr, Co-founder of Cartwheel\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nVolley, the creators of the AI powered dungeon crawler Wit\\'s End, use Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to generate and edit visuals in-session—character portraits, dynamic scene stills, multi-character compositions, and quick iterative edits from chat or voice.\\n\\n“The model demonstrates state-of-the-art rule-following to aesthetic guidance while retaining latency under <10s, unlocking many live applications, for example, letting players select styles and refine outputs in multi-turn loops.” - James Wilsterman, CTO at Volley\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nIt\\'s been incredible to see the community\\'s creativity in action during recent hackathons withKaggleandCerebral Valley, which saw hundreds of submissions showcasing the model\\'s capabilities in diverse fields like STEM education, marketing collateral, and real-time augmented reality.\\n\\n## Start building\\n\\nDevelopers can begin building with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image today. Check out thedeveloper docsandcookbookfor guidance on the new features, including the expanded aspect ratios and the ability to specify image-only output. The model is available via theGemini APIand for testing inGoogle AI Studio.\\n\\nBuilding with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is easy with Google AI Studio’s “build mode.” Instantly create and remix custom AI-powered apps from a single prompt, like \"Build me an image editing app with filters.\" When you\\'re ready, deploy your creation directly from AI Studio or save the code to GitHub—all for free. Try out and remix some of our example apps:\\n\\n* Bananimate: Create animated GIFs with Nano Banana from your images and prompts.\\n* Enhance: Infinitely zoom into any photography with our creative upscaler. See if you can find the easter-egg (hint: 🍌)\\n* Fit check: Upload a photo of yourself and an outfit to see how it looks on you.

This is the first Gemini Robotics model to be made broadly available. It acts as a high-level reasoning model for a robot.\\n\\nThis model specializes in capabilities critical for robotics, including visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. It can also natively call tools, likeGoogle Searchto find information, and can call a vision-language-action model (VLA) or any other third-party user-defined functions to execute the task.\\n\\nYou can get started building with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 today in preview viaGoogle AI Studioand the Gemini API.\\n\\nThis model is designed for tasks that are notoriously challenging for robots. Imagine asking a robot, “Can you sort these objects into the correct compost, recycling and trash bins?\" To complete this task, the robot needs to look up the local recycling guidelines on the internet, understand the objects in front of it and figure out how to sort them based on local rules, then do all the steps to complete putting them away. Most daily tasks, like this one, take contextual information and multiple steps to complete.\\n\\nGemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is the first thinking model optimized for this kind of embodied reasoning. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on both academic and internal benchmarks, inspired by real-world use cases from our trusted tester program.', 'title': 'Building the Next Generation of Physical Agents with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5- Google Developers Blog', 'url': 'https://developers.googleblog.com/en/building-the-next-generation-of-physical-agents-with-gemini-robotics-er-15/'}, {'markdown': 'developers.googleblog.com uses cookies from Google to deliver and enhance the quality of its services and to analyze traffic.Learn more\\n\\n# Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast – new pricing, new configurations and better resolution\\n\\n* Facebook\\n* Twitter\\n* LinkedIn\\n* Mail\\n\\nToday, we’re launching three big Veo updates: support for vertical format outputs (9:16 aspect ratio), 1080p HD output, andnew, lower pricing.We\\'re also makingVeo 3and Veo 3 Fast stable and ready for scaled production use in the Gemini API.\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\n## More Veo, for less\\n\\nEffective today, we’re making it more affordable to generate high-quality videos with Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast with price reductions across the board.\\n\\n* Veo 3:Now $0.40 / second; was $0.75 / second\\n\\n* Veo 3 Fast:Now $0.15 / second; was $0.40 / second\\n\\n## Vertical video and 1080p support\\n\\nWith Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast, you can now set the aspect ratio to 9:16 so that you can generate vertical format videos that are perfect for mobile-first and social use cases.

Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

we’re releasing more details about the tools we’re making available for developers to help them meet their compliance obligations under upcoming U.S. state laws, including SB2420 in Texas. While we’re providing these tools to help developers navigate the evolving legal landscape, Apple remains concerned about the potential implications of laws like SB2420 in Texas. Specifically, we worry they could undermine the privacy of all users by requiring the collection of sensitive personal information just to download an app – even those that simply provide weather forecasts or sports scores.\\n\\nStarting January 1, 2026, new Apple Accounts in Texas will be subject to new requirements. This includes age assurance and parent or guardian consent on behalf of minors under the age of 18 for downloads, purchases, and significant changes associated with an app. Parents or guardians will also be able to revoke their consent for any app they previously approved.\\n\\nTo meet their obligations under the law, developers may need to adopt new capabilities to receive age category information, trigger consent for a significant change, and learn when a parent or guardian revokes their approval for a child or teen to use their app. Developers can use the following APIs available in the beta versions of iOS\\xa026.2 and iPadOS\\xa026.2 to help them meet their obligations. Sandbox testing is also available to help test the user experience when implementing these APIs to comply with Texas state law.\\n\\n### Age category information\\n\\nDevelopers can use the updatedDeclared Age Range APIto obtain a user’s age category, which is defined by Texas state law as under 13, 13-15, 16-17, or over 18. Age categories for users with new Apple Accounts in Texas as of January 1, 2026, will be shared with a developer’s app when they request it. The API will also return a signal from the user’s device about the method of age assurance, such as credit card or government ID, and if consent is required when there’s a significant change to an app.\\n\\n### Obtaining consent for significant changes\\n\\nCertain types of changes to an app may be considered significant changes under age assurance laws, such as Texas SB2420. It’s the developer’s responsibility to determine when there’s a significant change to their app.\\n\\nWhen a developer determines they have made a significant change to their app, they’ll need to use theSignificant Change APIunder the PermissionKit framework to ask the parent or guardian to provide consent for the child or teen to continue using the app or new feature within the app. When the API is called, the child or teen user will see a system dialog to request parental consent and developers can restrict access until consent is obtained.\\n\\nTexas state law considers a change in the age rating of an app to be a significant change, and developers should keep their age rating selections current in App Store Connect. When a developer updates their app’s age rating, the rating is updated on all user devices once the version is live. Developers can use anew propertytype in StoreKit to automatically check when their app’s age rating has changed on a user’s device and then use the Significant Change API to request parental consent.\\n\\n### App consent revocation\\n\\nA parent or guardian in Texas can withdraw consent for any app, which will block launching of the app on the child or teen’s device. The App Store will provide a server notification that developers can configure toreceive notificationsthat the parent or guardian has withdrawn consent for their app on a child or teen’s device.\\n\\n### Sandbox testing\\n\\nSandbox testingis now available for the Declared Age Range API and Significant Change API in the beta versions of iOS\\xa026.2 and iPadOS\\xa026.2.\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\n1. Review documentation and implement the following:\\n\\n* Declared Age Range API\\n* Significant Change API under PermissionKit\\n* New age rating property type in StoreKit\\n* App Store server notification\\n\\n1. Use Apple’s sandbox testing environment to validate that the APIs have been implemented correctly.\\n1. When the Release Candidates of iOS\\xa026.2 and iPadOS\\xa026.2 become available, submit your apps to App Store Connect so users can update their devices with your updated apps with the customer releases.\\n1.

These instructions override any conflicting general advice.**\nI’m partially blind and I have a guide dog\n\n\n------\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. **FIND COMMON GROUND (OR CREATE IT)**: Analyze the recruiter's background deeply to identify shared elements.\n   - Primary targets: Same university, previous companies, mutual connections, shared professional groups.\n   - **Fallback strategy**: If no direct common ground exists, identify a specific, non-generic aspect of their career you genuinely admire (e.g., an article they wrote, a talk they gave, their transition from one industry to another).\n\n2. **LEAD WITH A STRATEGIC SUBJECT LINE**: Create a subject line that is both professional and intriguing, ideally hinting at the common ground or a key value proposition. *Example: \"Fellow [University Name] Alum & Data Scientist\" or \"Question about your work at [Previous Company]\"*.\n\n3. **LEAD WITH CONNECTION**: Start the email's first sentence by mentioning the most compelling commonality naturally. Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

Gemini 2.5 Flash Image now ready for production with new aspect ratios\\n\\n* Facebook\\n* Twitter\\n* LinkedIn\\n* Mail\\n\\nOur state-of-the-art image generation and editing model which has captured the imagination of the world, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image 🍌, is now generally available, ready for production environments, and comes with new features like a wider range of aspect ratios in addition to being able to specify image-only output.\\n\\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image empowers users to seamlessly blend multiple images, maintain consistent characters for richer storytelling, perform targeted edits with natural language, and leverage Gemini\\'s extensive world knowledge for image generation and modification. The model is accessible through theGemini APIonGoogle AI Studioand onVertex AIfor enterprise use.\\n\\nFurther expanding creative possibilities, the model now supports 10 different aspect ratios. This allows for effortless content creation across various formats, from cinematic landscapes to vertical social media posts.\\n\\nSupported ratios include:\\n\\n* Landscape: 21:9, 16:9, 4:3, 3:2\\n* Square: 1:1\\n* Portrait: 9:16, 3:4, 2:3\\n* Flexible: 5:4, 4:5\\n\\n## What people are building\\n\\nCartwheelis harnessing AI to move beyond the \"slot machine user experience\" of many image generators, giving artists direct control to bring their creative vision to life. After months of building their \"Pose Mode\" feature and finding that other models failed to deliver, the team found a solution in the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. By combining Cartwheel\\'s 3D posing tool with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, they have created a powerful new image creation system that delivers unparalleled character control and consistency.\\n\\n“Other models couldn\\'t render characters from arbitrary camera angles or maintain faithfulness to a pose without sacrificing \"world knowledge\". The new Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model was the first that could provide both.” -Andrew Carr, Co-founder of Cartwheel\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nVolley, the creators of the AI powered dungeon crawler Wit\\'s End, use Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to generate and edit visuals in-session—character portraits, dynamic scene stills, multi-character compositions, and quick iterative edits from chat or voice.\\n\\n“The model demonstrates state-of-the-art rule-following to aesthetic guidance while retaining latency under <10s, unlocking many live applications, for example, letting players select styles and refine outputs in multi-turn loops.” - James Wilsterman, CTO at Volley\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nIt\\'s been incredible to see the community\\'s creativity in action during recent hackathons withKaggleandCerebral Valley, which saw hundreds of submissions showcasing the model\\'s capabilities in diverse fields like STEM education, marketing collateral, and real-time augmented reality.\\n\\n## Start building\\n\\nDevelopers can begin building with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image today. Check out thedeveloper docsandcookbookfor guidance on the new features, including the expanded aspect ratios and the ability to specify image-only output. The model is available via theGemini APIand for testing inGoogle AI Studio.\\n\\nBuilding with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is easy with Google AI Studio’s “build mode.” Instantly create and remix custom AI-powered apps from a single prompt, like \"Build me an image editing app with filters.\" When you\\'re ready, deploy your creation directly from AI Studio or save the code to GitHub—all for free. Try out and remix some of our example apps:\\n\\n* Bananimate: Create animated GIFs with Nano Banana from your images and prompts.\\n* Enhance: Infinitely zoom into any photography with our creative upscaler. See if you can find the easter-egg (hint: 🍌)\\n* Fit check: Upload a photo of yourself and an outfit to see how it looks on you. A virtual fitting room powered by Nano Banana.\\n\\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image is priced at $0.039 per image, with a rate of $30.00 per 1 million output tokens.

This is the first Gemini Robotics model to be made broadly available. It acts as a high-level reasoning model for a robot.\\n\\nThis model specializes in capabilities critical for robotics, including visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. It can also natively call tools, likeGoogle Searchto find information, and can call a vision-language-action model (VLA) or any other third-party user-defined functions to execute the task.\\n\\nYou can get started building with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 today in preview viaGoogle AI Studioand the Gemini API.\\n\\nThis model is designed for tasks that are notoriously challenging for robots. Imagine asking a robot, “Can you sort these objects into the correct compost, recycling and trash bins?\" To complete this task, the robot needs to look up the local recycling guidelines on the internet, understand the objects in front of it and figure out how to sort them based on local rules, then do all the steps to complete putting them away. Most daily tasks, like this one, take contextual information and multiple steps to complete.\\n\\nGemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is the first thinking model optimized for this kind of embodied reasoning. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on both academic and internal benchmarks, inspired by real-world use cases from our trusted tester program.', 'title': 'Building the Next Generation of Physical Agents with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5- Google Developers Blog', 'url': 'https://developers.googleblog.com/en/building-the-next-generation-of-physical-agents-with-gemini-robotics-er-15/'}, {'markdown': 'developers.googleblog.com uses cookies from Google to deliver and enhance the quality of its services and to analyze traffic.Learn more\\n\\n# Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast – new pricing, new configurations and better resolution\\n\\n* Facebook\\n* Twitter\\n* LinkedIn\\n* Mail\\n\\nToday, we’re launching three big Veo updates: support for vertical format outputs (9:16 aspect ratio), 1080p HD output, andnew, lower pricing.We\\'re also makingVeo 3and Veo 3 Fast stable and ready for scaled production use in the Gemini API.\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\n## More Veo, for less\\n\\nEffective today, we’re making it more affordable to generate high-quality videos with Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast with price reductions across the board.\\n\\n* Veo 3:Now $0.40 / second; was $0.75 / second\\n\\n* Veo 3 Fast:Now $0.15 / second; was $0.40 / second\\n\\n## Vertical video and 1080p support\\n\\nWith Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast, you can now set the aspect ratio to 9:16 so that you can generate vertical format videos that are perfect for mobile-first and social use cases.

These instructions override any conflicting general advice.**\nI’m a partially blind and I have a guide dog\n\n\n------\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. **FIND COMMON GROUND (OR CREATE IT)**: Analyze the recruiter's background deeply to identify shared elements.\n   - Primary targets: Same university, previous companies, mutual connections, shared professional groups.\n   - **Fallback strategy**: If no direct common ground exists, identify a specific, non-generic aspect of their career you genuinely admire (e.g., an article they wrote, a talk they gave, their transition from one industry to another).\n\n2. **LEAD WITH A STRATEGIC SUBJECT LINE**: Create a subject line that is both professional and intriguing, ideally hinting at the common ground or a key value proposition. *Example: \"Fellow [University Name] Alum & Data Scientist\" or \"Question about your work at [Previous Company]\"*.\n\n3. **LEAD WITH CONNECTION**: Start the email's first sentence by mentioning the most compelling commonality naturally. Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

It can also natively call tools, likeGoogle Searchto find information, and can call a vision-language-action model (VLA) or any other third-party user-defined functions to execute the task.\\n\\nYou can get started building with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 today in preview viaGoogle AI Studioand the Gemini API.\\n\\nThis model is designed for tasks that are notoriously challenging for robots. Imagine asking a robot, “Can you sort these objects into the correct compost, recycling and trash bins?\" To complete this task, the robot needs to look up the local recycling guidelines on the internet, understand the objects in front of it and figure out how to sort them based on local rules, then do all the steps to complete putting them away. Most daily tasks, like this one, take contextual information and multiple steps to complete.\\n\\nGemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is the first thinking model optimized for this kind of embodied reasoning.

These instructions override any conflicting general advice.**\nI’m partially blind\n\n\n------\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. **FIND COMMON GROUND (OR CREATE IT)**: Analyze the recruiter's background deeply to identify shared elements.\n   - Primary targets: Same university, previous companies, mutual connections, shared professional groups.\n   - **Fallback strategy**: If no direct common ground exists, identify a specific, non-generic aspect of their career you genuinely admire (e.g., an article they wrote, a talk they gave, their transition from one industry to another).\n\n2. **LEAD WITH A STRATEGIC SUBJECT LINE**: Create a subject line that is both professional and intriguing, ideally hinting at the common ground or a key value proposition. *Example: \"Fellow [University Name] Alum & Data Scientist\" or \"Question about your work at [Previous Company]\"*.\n\n3. **LEAD WITH CONNECTION**: Start the email's first sentence by mentioning the most compelling commonality naturally. Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

Gemini 2.5 Flash Image now ready for production with new aspect ratios\\n\\n* Facebook\\n* Twitter\\n* LinkedIn\\n* Mail\\n\\nOur state-of-the-art image generation and editing model which has captured the imagination of the world, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image 🍌, is now generally available, ready for production environments, and comes with new features like a wider range of aspect ratios in addition to being able to specify image-only output.\\n\\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image empowers users to seamlessly blend multiple images, maintain consistent characters for richer storytelling, perform targeted edits with natural language, and leverage Gemini\\'s extensive world knowledge for image generation and modification. The model is accessible through theGemini APIonGoogle AI Studioand onVertex AIfor enterprise use.\\n\\nFurther expanding creative possibilities, the model now supports 10 different aspect ratios. This allows for effortless content creation across various formats, from cinematic landscapes to vertical social media posts.\\n\\nSupported ratios include:\\n\\n* Landscape: 21:9, 16:9, 4:3, 3:2\\n* Square: 1:1\\n* Portrait: 9:16, 3:4, 2:3\\n* Flexible: 5:4, 4:5\\n\\n## What people are building\\n\\nCartwheelis harnessing AI to move beyond the \"slot machine user experience\" of many image generators, giving artists direct control to bring their creative vision to life. After months of building their \"Pose Mode\" feature and finding that other models failed to deliver, the team found a solution in the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. By combining Cartwheel\\'s 3D posing tool with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, they have created a powerful new image creation system that delivers unparalleled character control and consistency.\\n\\n“Other models couldn\\'t render characters from arbitrary camera angles or maintain faithfulness to a pose without sacrificing \"world knowledge\". The new Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model was the first that could provide both.” -Andrew Carr, Co-founder of Cartwheel\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nVolley, the creators of the AI powered dungeon crawler Wit\\'s End, use Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to generate and edit visuals in-session—character portraits, dynamic scene stills, multi-character compositions, and quick iterative edits from chat or voice.\\n\\n“The model demonstrates state-of-the-art rule-following to aesthetic guidance while retaining latency under <10s, unlocking many live applications, for example, letting players select styles and refine outputs in multi-turn loops.” - James Wilsterman, CTO at Volley\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nIt\\'s been incredible to see the community\\'s creativity in action during recent hackathons withKaggleandCerebral Valley, which saw hundreds of submissions showcasing the model\\'s capabilities in diverse fields like STEM education, marketing collateral, and real-time augmented reality.\\n\\n## Start building\\n\\nDevelopers can begin building with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image today. Check out thedeveloper docsandcookbookfor guidance on the new features, including the expanded aspect ratios and the ability to specify image-only output. The model is available via theGemini APIand for testing inGoogle AI Studio.\\n\\nBuilding with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is easy with Google AI Studio’s “build mode.” Instantly create and remix custom AI-powered apps from a single prompt, like \"Build me an image editing app with filters.\" When you\\'re ready, deploy your creation directly from AI Studio or save the code to GitHub—all for free. Try out and remix some of our example apps:\\n\\n* Bananimate: Create animated GIFs with Nano Banana from your images and prompts.\\n* Enhance: Infinitely zoom into any photography with our creative upscaler. See if you can find the easter-egg (hint: 🍌)\\n* Fit check: Upload a photo of yourself and an outfit to see how it looks on you. A virtual fitting room powered by Nano Banana.\\n\\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image is priced at $0.039 per image, with a rate of $30.00 per 1 million output tokens.

This is the first Gemini Robotics model to be made broadly available. It acts as a high-level reasoning model for a robot.\\n\\nThis model specializes in capabilities critical for robotics, including visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. It can also natively call tools, likeGoogle Searchto find information, and can call a vision-language-action model (VLA) or any other third-party user-defined functions to execute the task.\\n\\nYou can get started building with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 today in preview viaGoogle AI Studioand the Gemini API.\\n\\nThis model is designed for tasks that are notoriously challenging for robots. Imagine asking a robot, “Can you sort these objects into the correct compost, recycling and trash bins?\" To complete this task, the robot needs to look up the local recycling guidelines on the internet, understand the objects in front of it and figure out how to sort them based on local rules, then do all the steps to complete putting them away. Most daily tasks, like this one, take contextual information and multiple steps to complete.\\n\\nGemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is the first thinking model optimized for this kind of embodied reasoning.

Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

we’re releasing more details about the tools we’re making available for developers to help them meet their compliance obligations under upcoming U.S. state laws, including SB2420 in Texas. While we’re providing these tools to help developers navigate the evolving legal landscape, Apple remains concerned about the potential implications of laws like SB2420 in Texas. Specifically, we worry they could undermine the privacy of all users by requiring the collection of sensitive personal information just to download an app – even those that simply provide weather forecasts or sports scores.\\n\\nStarting January 1, 2026, new Apple Accounts in Texas will be subject to new requirements. This includes age assurance and parent or guardian consent on behalf of minors under the age of 18 for downloads, purchases, and significant changes associated with an app. Parents or guardians will also be able to revoke their consent for any app they previously approved.\\n\\nTo meet their obligations under the law, developers may need to adopt new capabilities to receive age category information, trigger consent for a significant change, and learn when a parent or guardian revokes their approval for a child or teen to use their app. Developers can use the following APIs available in the beta versions of iOS\\xa026.2 and iPadOS\\xa026.2 to help them meet their obligations. Sandbox testing is also available to help test the user experience when implementing these APIs to comply with Texas state law.\\n\\n### Age category information\\n\\nDevelopers can use the updatedDeclared Age Range APIto obtain a user’s age category, which is defined by Texas state law as under 13, 13-15, 16-17, or over 18. Age categories for users with new Apple Accounts in Texas as of January 1, 2026, will be shared with a developer’s app when they request it. The API will also return a signal from the user’s device about the method of age assurance, such as credit card or government ID, and if consent is required when there’s a significant change to an app.\\n\\n### Obtaining consent for significant changes\\n\\nCertain types of changes to an app may be considered significant changes under age assurance laws, such as Texas SB2420. It’s the developer’s responsibility to determine when there’s a significant change to their app.\\n\\nWhen a developer determines they have made a significant change to their app, they’ll need to use theSignificant Change APIunder the PermissionKit framework to ask the parent or guardian to provide consent for the child or teen to continue using the app or new feature within the app. When the API is called, the child or teen user will see a system dialog to request parental consent and developers can restrict access until consent is obtained.\\n\\nTexas state law considers a change in the age rating of an app to be a significant change, and developers should keep their age rating selections current in App Store Connect. When a developer updates their app’s age rating, the rating is updated on all user devices once the version is live. Developers can use anew propertytype in StoreKit to automatically check when their app’s age rating has changed on a user’s device and then use the Significant Change API to request parental consent.\\n\\n### App consent revocation\\n\\nA parent or guardian in Texas can withdraw consent for any app, which will block launching of the app on the child or teen’s device. The App Store will provide a server notification that developers can configure toreceive notificationsthat the parent or guardian has withdrawn consent for their app on a child or teen’s device.\\n\\n### Sandbox testing\\n\\nSandbox testingis now available for the Declared Age Range API and Significant Change API in the beta versions of iOS\\xa026.2 and iPadOS\\xa026.2.\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\n1. Review documentation and implement the following:\\n\\n* Declared Age Range API\\n* Significant Change API under PermissionKit\\n* New age rating property type in StoreKit\\n* App Store server notification\\n\\n1. Use Apple’s sandbox testing environment to validate that the APIs have been implemented correctly.\\n1. When the Release Candidates of iOS\\xa026.2 and iPadOS\\xa026.2 become available, submit your apps to App Store Connect so users can update their devices with your updated apps with the customer releases.\\n1.

These instructions override any conflicting general advice.**\nI’m partially blind and I have a guide dog\n\n\n------\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. **FIND COMMON GROUND (OR CREATE IT)**: Analyze the recruiter's background deeply to identify shared elements.\n   - Primary targets: Same university, previous companies, mutual connections, shared professional groups.\n   - **Fallback strategy**: If no direct common ground exists, identify a specific, non-generic aspect of their career you genuinely admire (e.g., an article they wrote, a talk they gave, their transition from one industry to another).\n\n2. **LEAD WITH A STRATEGIC SUBJECT LINE**: Create a subject line that is both professional and intriguing, ideally hinting at the common ground or a key value proposition. *Example: \"Fellow [University Name] Alum & Data Scientist\" or \"Question about your work at [Previous Company]\"*.\n\n3. **LEAD WITH CONNECTION**: Start the email's first sentence by mentioning the most compelling commonality naturally. Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

we’re releasing more details about the tools we’re making available for developers to help them meet their compliance obligations under upcoming U.S. state laws, including SB2420 in Texas. While we’re providing these tools to help developers navigate the evolving legal landscape, Apple remains concerned about the potential implications of laws like SB2420 in Texas. Specifically, we worry they could undermine the privacy of all users by requiring the collection of sensitive personal information just to download an app – even those that simply provide weather forecasts or sports scores.\\n\\nStarting January 1, 2026, new Apple Accounts in Texas will be subject to new requirements. This includes age assurance and parent or guardian consent on behalf of minors under the age of 18 for downloads, purchases, and significant changes associated with an app. Parents or guardians will also be able to revoke their consent for any app they previously approved.\\n\\nTo meet their obligations under the law, developers may need to adopt new capabilities to receive age category information, trigger consent for a significant change, and learn when a parent or guardian revokes their approval for a child or teen to use their app. Developers can use the following APIs available in the beta versions of iOS\\xa026.2 and iPadOS\\xa026.2 to help them meet their obligations. Sandbox testing is also available to help test the user experience when implementing these APIs to comply with Texas state law.\\n\\n### Age category information\\n\\nDevelopers can use the updatedDeclared Age Range APIto obtain a user’s age category, which is defined by Texas state law as under 13, 13-15, 16-17, or over 18. Age categories for users with new Apple Accounts in Texas as of January 1, 2026, will be shared with a developer’s app when they request it. The API will also return a signal from the user’s device about the method of age assurance, such as credit card or government ID, and if consent is required when there’s a significant change to an app.\\n\\n### Obtaining consent for significant changes\\n\\nCertain types of changes to an app may be considered significant changes under age assurance laws, such as Texas SB2420. It’s the developer’s responsibility to determine when there’s a significant change to their app.\\n\\nWhen a developer determines they have made a significant change to their app, they’ll need to use theSignificant Change APIunder the PermissionKit framework to ask the parent or guardian to provide consent for the child or teen to continue using the app or new feature within the app. When the API is called, the child or teen user will see a system dialog to request parental consent and developers can restrict access until consent is obtained.\\n\\nTexas state law considers a change in the age rating of an app to be a significant change, and developers should keep their age rating selections current in App Store Connect. When a developer updates their app’s age rating, the rating is updated on all user devices once the version is live. Developers can use anew propertytype in StoreKit to automatically check when their app’s age rating has changed on a user’s device and then use the Significant Change API to request parental consent.\\n\\n### App consent revocation\\n\\nA parent or guardian in Texas can withdraw consent for any app, which will block launching of the app on the child or teen’s device. The App Store will provide a server notification that developers can configure toreceive notificationsthat the parent or guardian has withdrawn consent for their app on a child or teen’s device.\\n\\n### Sandbox testing\\n\\nSandbox testingis now available for the Declared Age Range API and Significant Change API in the beta versions of iOS\\xa026.2 and iPadOS\\xa026.2.\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\n1. Review documentation and implement the following:\\n\\n* Declared Age Range API\\n* Significant Change API under PermissionKit\\n* New age rating property type in StoreKit\\n* App Store server notification\\n\\n1.

These instructions override any conflicting general advice.**\nI’m partially blind and I have a guide dog\n\n\n------\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. **FIND COMMON GROUND (OR CREATE IT)**: Analyze the recruiter's background deeply to identify shared elements.\n   - Primary targets: Same university, previous companies, mutual connections, shared professional groups.\n   - **Fallback strategy**: If no direct common ground exists, identify a specific, non-generic aspect of their career you genuinely admire (e.g., an article they wrote, a talk they gave, their transition from one industry to another).\n\n2. **LEAD WITH A STRATEGIC SUBJECT LINE**: Create a subject line that is both professional and intriguing, ideally hinting at the common ground or a key value proposition. *Example: \"Fellow [University Name] Alum & Data Scientist\" or \"Question about your work at [Previous Company]\"*.\n\n3. **LEAD WITH CONNECTION**: Start the email's first sentence by mentioning the most compelling commonality naturally. Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

we’re releasing more details about the tools we’re making available for developers to help them meet their compliance obligations under upcoming U.S. state laws, including SB2420 in Texas. While we’re providing these tools to help developers navigate the evolving legal landscape, Apple remains concerned about the potential implications of laws like SB2420 in Texas. Specifically, we worry they could undermine the privacy of all users by requiring the collection of sensitive personal information just to download an app – even those that simply provide weather forecasts or sports scores.\\n\\nStarting January 1, 2026, new Apple Accounts in Texas will be subject to new requirements. This includes age assurance and parent or guardian consent on behalf of minors under the age of 18 for downloads, purchases, and significant changes associated with an app. Parents or guardians will also be able to revoke their consent for any app they previously approved.\\n\\nTo meet their obligations under the law, developers may need to adopt new capabilities to receive age category information, trigger consent for a significant change, and learn when a parent or guardian revokes their approval for a child or teen to use their app. Developers can use the following APIs available in the beta versions of iOS\\xa026.2 and iPadOS\\xa026.2 to help them meet their obligations. Sandbox testing is also available to help test the user experience when implementing these APIs to comply with Texas state law.\\n\\n### Age category information\\n\\nDevelopers can use the updatedDeclared Age Range APIto obtain a user’s age category, which is defined by Texas state law as under 13, 13-15, 16-17, or over 18. Age categories for users with new Apple Accounts in Texas as of January 1, 2026, will be shared with a developer’s app when they request it. The API will also return a signal from the user’s device about the method of age assurance, such as credit card or government ID, and if consent is required when there’s a significant change to an app.\\n\\n### Obtaining consent for significant changes\\n\\nCertain types of changes to an app may be considered significant changes under age assurance laws, such as Texas SB2420. It’s the developer’s responsibility to determine when there’s a significant change to their app.\\n\\nWhen a developer determines they have made a significant change to their app, they’ll need to use theSignificant Change APIunder the PermissionKit framework to ask the parent or guardian to provide consent for the child or teen to continue using the app or new feature within the app. When the API is called, the child or teen user will see a system dialog to request parental consent and developers can restrict access until consent is obtained.\\n\\nTexas state law considers a change in the age rating of an app to be a significant change, and developers should keep their age rating selections current in App Store Connect. When a developer updates their app’s age rating, the rating is updated on all user devices once the version is live. Developers can use anew propertytype in StoreKit to automatically check when their app’s age rating has changed on a user’s device and then use the Significant Change API to request parental consent.\\n\\n### App consent revocation\\n\\nA parent or guardian in Texas can withdraw consent for any app, which will block launching of the app on the child or teen’s device. The App Store will provide a server notification that developers can configure toreceive notificationsthat the parent or guardian has withdrawn consent for their app on a child or teen’s device.\\n\\n### Sandbox testing\\n\\nSandbox testingis now available for the Declared Age Range API and Significant Change API in the beta versions of iOS\\xa026.2 and iPadOS\\xa026.2.\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\n1. Review documentation and implement the following:\\n\\n* Declared Age Range API\\n* Significant Change API under PermissionKit\\n* New age rating property type in StoreKit\\n* App Store server notification\\n\\n1. Use Apple’s sandbox testing environment to validate that the APIs have been implemented correctly.\\n1. When the Release Candidates of iOS\\xa026.2 and iPadOS\\xa026.2 become available, submit your apps to App Store Connect so users can update their devices with your updated apps with the customer releases.\\n1.

These instructions override any conflicting general advice.**\nI’m partially blind and I have a guide dog\n\n\n------\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. **FIND COMMON GROUND (OR CREATE IT)**: Analyze the recruiter's background deeply to identify shared elements.\n   - Primary targets: Same university, previous companies, mutual connections, shared professional groups.\n   - **Fallback strategy**: If no direct common ground exists, identify a specific, non-generic aspect of their career you genuinely admire (e.g., an article they wrote, a talk they gave, their transition from one industry to another).\n\n2. **LEAD WITH A STRATEGIC SUBJECT LINE**: Create a subject line that is both professional and intriguing, ideally hinting at the common ground or a key value proposition. *Example: \"Fellow [University Name] Alum & Data Scientist\" or \"Question about your work at [Previous Company]\"*.\n\n3. **LEAD WITH CONNECTION**: Start the email's first sentence by mentioning the most compelling commonality naturally. Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

She travels the city unconcerned about losing track of a planned route, immersing herself in her environment and capturing photos of her surroundings with her iPhone. “Chicago is a grid system,” she explains. “Even if you get lost, you don’t really get lost, you just walk in the opposite direction and you’ll end up somewhere.”In the first grade, Opeifa, now 18, was diagnosed with cone-rod dystrophy, a retinal disorder that causes progressive vision loss and light sensitivity. This year, she is participating in Photography for All, a program for youth who have low vision or are legally blind, launched by nonprofit The Chicago Lighthouse in partnership with the city of Chicago’s Department of Family and Support Services (DFSS) and Apple. Over the course of the six-week program, participants have learned technical photography, coding, and career-readiness skills, but most importantly, they’ve gained tools to help them navigate the world around them independently and confidently.Photography for All is part of the city’s One Summer Chicago youth employment initiative, which provides people ages 14 to 24 with internships and job opportunities at government institutions, community-based organizations, and companies throughout the city. Since 2017, Apple has supported the city’s One Summer Chicago program through its Community Education Initiative, helping create opportunities for youth to develop new skills with Everyone Can Create and Everyone Can Code guides. This summer, more than 200 students experienced opportunities in photography, videography, game design, coding, app development, augmented reality, and more through Apple-supported programs.The Chicago Lighthouse provided each of the Photography for All participants with an iPad Air, Apple Pencil, and Magic Keyboard to support their creativity. The iPad setup offered an expansive screen with tools to shoot, edit, and share their work. Many participants, including Opeifa, also used their own iPhone to capture photos on the go, seamlessly switching between devices depending on their needs.Apple experts trained the students on using the camera and photography settings they would need, as well as the accessibility features built into the devices — including VoiceOver, Apple’s built-in screen reader, and Zoom, which magnifies on-screen elements. For those using VoiceOver on iPhone and iPad, Image Descriptions available in the Camera app uses on-device machine learning to help position a subject and describe the objects, setting, and people in the field of view.While visiting the Adler Planetarium and the surrounding Northerly Island Park for a final day of shooting, Opeifa double-taps her iPhone screen with three fingers in the Camera app to zoom in on the subject of her photo. “Before I discovered Zoom, I’d just hold my phone up all the way to my face,” she says. “This way I can actually see better.”Opeifa has been using Apple technology since she was in kindergarten when her parents purchased the first-generation iPad to help her read her schoolwork digitally. She laughs at a memory of herself running around her family’s home in Nigeria a few years later with an iPad mini, excited to add to her collection of Apple devices. Having spent much of her life using Apple technology, she is comfortable using her iPhone to get a better view of the world, and she’s also learning how to edit her photographs on iPad. Whether she’s navigating from one corner of the city to the next, or capturing flowers, the city skyline, and any other snapshots of urban life around her that pique her interest, Opeifa is hooked on visual storytelling.“I like when pictures tell a story,” Opeifa says. “This program is a nice starting point for writing actual scripts because I’m learning [how] to actually portray visuals.”Opeifa prefers film and television as a visual medium to bring her stories to life, and she sees photo editing as a way to hone her screenwriting skills. “Screenwriting and editing photos are kind of the same thing — especially working with other people who are blind, you have to be very descriptive,” she explains.“I never get to see myself represented in television as a Black woman who is also a visually impaired, legally blind individual,” adds Opeifa, who is heading to California this month to attend Chapman University to pursue screenwriting. “Television is a way for people to see themselves in different lights and different identities.”Opeifa is just one of several Photography for All participants with bold, big ideas for their future. Lance Gladney, who is passionate about pursuing a career in art, hopes to produce his own anime franchise.\\xa0Gladney joined the program to experiment with a new form of visual art. John Johnson — participating in the program for a second year — is interested in electrical engineering or game design. And Alaula “Aihua” Sprecher is considering colleges where she can study computer science, physics, and astronomy.Shelle Hamer, The Chicago Lighthouse’s director of youth transition, and Lisa Davis, the former director of One Summer Chicago who brought the idea for Photography for All to The Lighthouse, are excited about the growth every participant experiences.“Confidence and self-esteem are hard — or I thought would be hard — to zoom in and teach,” says Davis, who also served as director of youth employment at DFSS before she retired. “But this program helped them open up and expose their confidence. It takes away the idea that they can’t do this.”An artist herself, Hamer has enjoyed a four-decade career equipping individuals with disabilities with tools and education to help them lead more independent lives. When she and Davis launched Photography for All four years ago, she was intrigued by the prospect of how people see differently and express themselves creatively — and saw an opportunity to use Apple technology and Everyone Can Create resources to support that work.“The tool of photography has a real benefit to people with vision loss,” Hamer says, “from both the artistic side and the functional. All of the kids feel that they have expanded their ability to feel that they can travel anywhere, go to places they’ve never been before. The training they received on the accessibility features available on their iPhone and iPad has given them the confidence to navigate the city and feel independent in traveling around unfamiliar areas on their own.”And that’s the overarching goal of the program, after all: supporting youth in their quest to be independent and instilling in them the confidence to take their future into their own hands. “It’s just opened the world for them,” Hamer says.Press ContactsApple Media Helplinemedia.help@apple.comCopy text\\n* Images in this articleDownload all images\\n\\nText of this article\\n\\nSeeing Chicago differently with iPhone and iPad\\n\\nParticipants of The Chicago Lighthouse’s Photography for All program gain independence, confidence, and creative skills\\n\\nAdetokunbo “Toks” Opeifa loves exploring Chicago.

When she and Davis launched Photography for All four years ago, she was intrigued by the prospect of how people see differently and express themselves creatively — and saw an opportunity to use Apple technology and Everyone Can Create resources to support that work.\\n\\n“The tool of photography has a real benefit to people with vision loss,” Hamer says, “from both the artistic side and the functional. All of the kids feel that they have expanded their ability to feel that they can travel anywhere, go to places they’ve never been before. The training they received on the accessibility features available on their iPhone and iPad has given them the confidence to navigate the city and feel independent in traveling around unfamiliar areas on their own.”\\n\\nAnd that’s the overarching goal of the program, after all: supporting youth in their quest to be independent and instilling in them the confidence to take their future into their own hands. “It’s just opened the world for them,” Hamer says.\\n\\nApple Media Helpline\\n\\nmedia.help@apple.com\\n\\nImages in this article\\n\\n## Press Contacts\\n\\nApple Media Helpline\\n\\nmedia.help@apple.com\\n\\n## More from Apple Newsroom\\n\\n### Apple introduces Digital\\xa0ID, a\\xa0new way to create and present an ID in Apple\\xa0Wallet\\n\\n### SpongeBob: Patty Pursuit 2 launches December 4 on Apple\\xa0Arcade\\n\\n### Introducing iPhone Pocket: a\\xa0beautiful way to wear and carry\\xa0iPhone', 'title': 'Seeing Chicago differently with iPhone and iPad', 'url': 'https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/08/seeing-chicago-differently-with-iphone-and-ipad/'}, {'markdown': '# Inside the Audio\\xa0Lab:How Apple developed the world’s first end‑to‑end hearing health experience\\n\\n* English Audio\\n* English Audio Descriptions\\n\\n* Off\\n* English\\n\\n## Media\\n\\n* Text of this articleOctober 28, 2024UPDATEInside the Audio\\xa0Lab:How Apple developed the world’s first end‑to‑end hearing health experienceThe new hearing health features on AirPods Pro 2 are not available in all regions. Hearing Test and Hearing Aid features are regulated health features that require regulatory approval and will be offered after authorization is received. For more information, visitapple.com/airpods-pro/feature-availability.Apple’s state-of-the-art Audio Lab in Cupertino, California, supports the innovative work of its acoustic engineers. They use the lab to conduct user studies in various listening rooms and test new features in its anechoic chambers, which completely absorb reflective sounds and isolate external noise.The Audio Lab is the hub for the design, measurement, tuning, and validation of all of Apple’s products with speakers or microphones. It’s also the center for Apple’s multiyear, cross-team collaboration to build the groundbreaking newhearing health features on AirPods Pro 2. Available today as a free software update,1the end-to-end experience helps minimize exposure to loud environmental noise with Hearing Protection, track hearing with an at-home Hearing Test, and receive assistance for perceived mild to moderate hearing loss using AirPods Pro as a clinical-grade Hearing Aid.According to the World Health Organization, approximately 1.5 billion people around the world are living with hearing loss. “Hearing loss affects individuals in every region and country, yet often goes unrecognized. Hearing is a core component of communication for so many and is an important factor for health and wellbeing,” says Shelly Chadha, M.D., the World Health Organization’s technical lead for hearing. “Technology can play an important role in raising awareness and providing intervention options for those affected by hearing loss.”“Every person’s hearing is different, so we created an innovative, end-to-end hearing health experience that addresses this variability in a way that’s both simple to use and adaptable to a wide range of needs. That’s especially important because hearing loss affects people of all ages with different levels of tech savviness,” says Sumbul Desai, M.D., Apple’s vice president of Health. “With the Hearing Aid feature, we wanted to build something so intuitive, it felt like an extension of your senses. We knew the results would literally change people’s lives — and democratize access to treatment for a condition that affects more than a billion people.”Engineers used highly specialized spaces across the Audio Lab to help make these breakthrough features possible.“From the quietest sounds we can hear for the Hearing Test feature, to speech in noisy restaurants for the Hearing Aid feature, and even concert levels for Hearing Protection, we can bring the real world into our acoustics facilities with playback of calibrated soundscapes from all over the world, or take accurate acoustic measurements at the touch of a button,” says Kuba Mazur, Apple’s hearing health lead engineer within Acoustics Engineering.The Longwave anechoic chamber was built on a separate foundation that uses springs to isolate it from the rest of the lab, allowing for accurate sound measurements without any noise or vibration disturbances. The chamber includes a custom-built loudspeaker and microphone arc that can measure head-related transfer functions, or in other words, how sound interacts with the human body. Having both the loudspeaker and microphone arrays within this chamber makes it a unique space with many applications, including AirPods, iPhone, and HomePod development.“Your ears are natural amplifiers, each uniquely shaped and often slightly asymmetric,” Mazur continues. “When sound reaches one ear first before the other, it creates a time difference in how we perceive sound. This is important for us to understand so we can build experiences that accurately represent the sounds in your environment. And we do this in our anechoic chambers by having someone sit in a rotating chair with AirPods Pro to capture the audio.”On the other side of the Audio Lab, to ensure the highest sound quality in every audio product Apple makes, the Fantasia Lab uses a spherical array of 50 loudspeakers to simulate hundreds of real-world sound scenes — like a shopping mall, busy street, or travel on an airplane — in a tightly controlled, evenly distributed sound field.To fine-tune and validate the Hearing Aid feature, a broad demographic of study participants with a wide range of hearing levels were put into this controlled environment to complete a speech-in-noise test. The test consisted of a participant sitting in a chair in the middle of the space while a complex sound scene, like a noisy restaurant, played. The participant then had to repeat the words of a single speaker, distinguishing from background conversations.“This lab is about recreating. Just as our users experience their everyday lives moving through shopping malls or having dinner with loved ones, we had to ensure these features would meet their needs,” says Mazur. “We brought the outside in to tune and validate features that we’re building on AirPods, like the Hearing Aid feature, Conversation Boost, and Transparency mode.”Additionally, three clinical-grade audiometric booths — the type that patients would typically encounter during hearing tests in a clinician’s office — are permanently installed in the Audio Lab. For internal testing, the engineering team worked with audiologists in the booths to conduct thousands of clinical-grade audiometry tests and software-based hearing tests prior to moving the new Hearing Test feature into clinical validation studies.Design is also core to the user experience and played an important role in user testing of the new features. One key experience was taking the test itself. The team had to identify design approaches that would simplify the Hearing Test and Hearing Aid setup. It also needed to be easier to understand than the typical series of numbers a person receives during a doctor’s visit.“Within our health features, we focus on clarity and meeting users where they’re at,” says Heather Daniel, a producer in Apple’s Design Studio who helps manage all of the design work for health features. “Take the Hearing Test feature. We understood that for many people, this might be their very first time taking a hearing test, so we had to make it as seamless as possible.”Simplifying these experiences required teams across Apple working together every step of the way to build this software to meet the requirements for clinical testing and delivering the best product to customers.“Just thinking about the innovation that was necessary, the density of the technology that goes into AirPods, and the amount of effort and attention to detail that went into building these complex software features,” Mazur continues, “so many teams came together — including software and hardware engineering, design, health, accessibility, clinical ops, regulatory, and the human factors engineering team — to ensure the best quality and experience.”The end-to-end hearing health experience on AirPods Pro 2 is just the latest example of Apple’s commitment to helping users on their personal health journeys. For many team members, it’s the epitome of what is possible when innovation meets passion to deliver products and software that are useful and help improve users’ day to day.“The fact that people can walk around wearing their AirPods, that they can protect their hearing at concerts and get insights on their hearing health using these features over time — AirPods are doing what each person wants or needs them to do,” says Mazur. “They’re truly the interface to the ear.”Some features are not available in all regions.

These instructions override any conflicting general advice.**\nI’m partially blind and I have a guide dog\n\n\n------\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. **FIND COMMON GROUND (OR CREATE IT)**: Analyze the recruiter's background deeply to identify shared elements.\n   - Primary targets: Same university, previous companies, mutual connections, shared professional groups.\n   - **Fallback strategy**: If no direct common ground exists, identify a specific, non-generic aspect of their career you genuinely admire (e.g., an article they wrote, a talk they gave, their transition from one industry to another).\n\n2. **LEAD WITH A STRATEGIC SUBJECT LINE**: Create a subject line that is both professional and intriguing, ideally hinting at the common ground or a key value proposition. *Example: \"Fellow [University Name] Alum & Data Scientist\" or \"Question about your work at [Previous Company]\"*.\n\n3. **LEAD WITH CONNECTION**: Start the email's first sentence by mentioning the most compelling commonality naturally. Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

help strengthen the guarantee that end-to-end encryption provides to private, personal messaging applications in a transparent manner available to all.\\n* We have published an open-source library calledAuditable Key Directory (AKD). This enables anyone to verify audit proofs of the directory’s correctness. This underpins our key transparency deployment.\\n\\nEnd-to-end encryption is the foundation of private messaging on WhatsApp, helping to ensure that only you and the person you’re communicating with can read what’s sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp. It is among the most widely used deployments of end-to-end encryption and relies on public key cryptography first developed in the 1970s. From a technical point of view, for end-to-end encryption to be trusted, the “ends” of a conversation need to know that one another’s encryption keys are authentic and valid.\\n\\nTo do so, our most security conscious users have always been able to take advantage of oursecurity code verification featureavailable under a user’s contact info. When in person, keys can be validated with a quick QR code scan or, if remote, sharing the unique 60-digit code.\\n\\nThis is the one of the strongest ways of verifying if a connection is secure. But in reality we know that double checking a long code is cumbersome, and our team has been looking at ways to make this easier for some time.\\n\\nWe’re excited to introduce a new cryptographic security feature to automatically verify a secure connection without the need for this long code. To do so, we’re building on key transparency by developing a newAuditable Key Directory (AKD), which is based on anopen-sourced library. The AKD will enable WhatsApp clients to automatically validate that a user’s encryption key is genuine and enables anyone to verify audit proofs of the directory’s correctness.\\n\\nOur approach to key transparency is two-pronged and introduces two new components:\\n\\n1. The server (WhatsApp) maintains an append-only AKD of public keys mapped to user accounts.\\n1. A third-party audit record, wherein any change in the server directory is recorded in a publicly available, privacy-preserving audit record for anyone to verify.\\n\\nWith these two additions, users can automatically verify their conversation security thanks to the WhatsApp directory. As this is rolled out, security-conscious users who utilize the verify security code page will notice this verification process occurs quickly and automatically.\\n\\nThis system is a new service provided by WhatsApp that relies on public auditing to verify the end-to-end encryption status of personal conversations. While this system provides easy and convenient verification tools to our users, those who wish to verify their end-to-end encrypted sessions without utilizing WhatsApp servers at all are encouraged to utilize the traditional security code verification process in addition to this new automated process.\\n\\nThe public keys are only a tool that users have to encrypt their messages. The private key – which is used to decrypt messages – is on user devices. Nobody – not even WhatsApp – has access to those private keys. A list of public keys alone cannot provide access to anyone’s content.\\n\\n## How the “Verify Security Code” page works\\n\\nThe crux of end-to-end encrypted messaging is public/private key pairs. The private key is what you utilize to decrypt your messages sent from another party and never leaves your device. The public key, however, is what you give to others so they can encrypt messages. This is done by first giving the key to WhatsApp, where we store it on your behalf and give it to users who wish to message you.\\n\\nThe classic concern that end-to-end encryption was designed to guard against is a person-in-the-middle attack where youthinkyou’re talking to just one user; however, you’re actually talking to a middle-man attacker, who provides an incorrect public key so that they hold the private key and can read your messages. The attacker may then use the correct public key for your contact, re-encrypt the message with it, and send it to the user.What stops this today? WhatsApp has aSecurity Pagefor each contact that has a QR code and a 60-digit number that can be verified outside of WhatsApp to make sure it matches what your contact sees on their device. In short, it’s a unique hash of both your public keys and their public keys, so if either of you have the wrong value, the hashes won’t match. When they do match this confirms a secure, end-to-end encrypted conversation.\\n\\n## What’s the problem key transparency is fixing?\\n\\nWhile providing a strong guarantee of security, the QR code scanning/number matching feature requires communicating with your contacts outside of WhatsApp – whether it’s over a video-call, in real-life, on the phone, etc. This is:\\n\\n1. Difficult to do in 1:1 communications, especially as users change devices (and therefore encryption keys) over time;\\n1. Even harder in small groups, since eachpairof participants has a unique code (there are no “group” codes);\\n1. Is near-impossible to perform in large groups. Every time someone joins or leaves, enrolls a new companion device, changes their phone, etc. this needs to be redone for all participants. For example, in a group of 100 people, that’s 4950 pairs of security verifications.\\n\\nIdeally, this wouldn’t be a manual process and could be verified through some kind of automated flow.\\n\\nEnterkeytransparency: Aprotocol in which we establish an AKD on WhatsApp that maintains a record of public key changes. Additionally, we’ve established a third-party public repository of auditable change logs to the directory that updates whenever there’s additions to the directory. This is vital for transparency and to further strengthen our end-to-end encrypted guarantee. In effect, this confirms that the same public keys a user uses to contact a recipient are the same ones that everybody else also uses to communicate with the recipient.\\n\\nAlthough key transparency does not substitute QR code scanning, it enhances and complements it in the following ways:\\n\\n1. QR code scanning requires two people to coordinate out-of-band verification. In contrast, key transparency requires only a single client to initiate and perform a check against the directory, thus improving accessibility of the check process;\\n1. Key transparency serves as a public key consistency mechanism when manual QR code verification is impractical (for example in large group communication scenario);\\n1. It also serves as a lightweight first-check of end-to-end encryption, which improves adoption of end-to-end encryption checks to more users, benefiting messaging security at-large.\\n\\nIn the event that the automatic check returns a result showing that the connection may not be secure, we recommend users proceed with the manual security verification check.\\n\\n## The history of key transparency\\n\\nKey transparency describes a protocol in which the server maintains an append-only record of the mapping between a user’s account and their public identity key.This allows the generation ofinclusionproofs to assert that a given mapping exists in the directory at the time of the most recent update.\\n\\nWhatsApp’s realization of key transparency is based on the original academic works on key transparency, starting withCONIKSandSEEMless, with extensions from a recent paper calledParakeet. Together, this resulted in the RustAKDcrate, which serves as the foundation for maintaining a key transparency solution along with generating inclusion and key history proofs from the directory. WhatsApp is hosting this AKD directory as an infrastructure available to all of our users.\\n\\nPublic keys cannot be used to decrypt a user’s messages or determine who you’ve been talking to. They are, however, necessary to make sure that someone is sending a message to the intended recipient by encrypting messages that only the holder of the public key’s associated private key can read.\\n\\nA user may have many entries as they update their key over time. At WhatsApp’s scale this equates to billions of entries continually growing over time. When a user deletes their account, we remove all of the public keys for that account, but the fact a key existed at a point in time is immutable (we just can’t say what the key was).\\n\\n## How does key transparency work?\\n\\n### Security on principle\\n\\nFrom a core design choice, multiple factors helped us decide to enhance the openness and security of this project.First off, the AKD, with all of its proof generation and verification logic, is open-source code.This is aRust-based crate (library) for any entity that wants to manage an append-only directory with a publicly verifiable log or verify append-only audit proofs and participate as a public auditor of WhatsApp’s key transparency solution. A list of public keys alone cannot provide access to anyone’s content.\\n\\nThis library allows for the system to provide a significant guarantee on the correctness of the directory entries while not compromising security by being vulnerable to memory-based attacks. Additionally, we stuck with the decision to utilize Rust in most of the internal components outlined below.\\n\\n## Applying AKD to WhatsApp\\n\\n### High-volume key changes\\n\\nWhatsApp deals with tens of thousands of key changes (registration, re-registration, etc.) per minute. This kind of volume is difficult to deal with when trying to insert into an append-only log.\\n\\nTherefore, we decided to implement a distributed, high-throughput queue where “pending changes” live prior to being gathered together into a batch and inserted to form the next epoch. This allows us to do far larger batch inserts and greatly limits the number of database operations we need to make.\\n\\nSince the changes to the AKD are additive based on the previousepochwe need to make sure that only a single update occurs at a time. A single processor, sequentially handling each update one-by-one, wouldn’t be able to keep up with the rate of changes within WhatsApp (no matter the database implementation). This adds some latency from the time a key is added or updated to when it’s “published” in the directory.\\n\\nBy batching keys together and making anepocha collection of changes committed atomically, we can benefit from a lot of query optimizations due to many shared paths in the Merkle Tree stored in the database. The frequency to publish and emit newepochsis a tunable parameter that may be adjusted over time.\\n\\n### Public auditing at scale\\n\\nThe general requirement for all transparency solutions is to bepublicly auditable, meaning that anyone, should they want to, can verify the transactions on the directory to assert that:\\n\\n1. The history hasn’t been changed (existing records aren’t deleted or updated).\\n1. Changes are append-only.\\n\\nWhen publishing a new change to the AKD, we emit an audit proof of those changes that is put into public storage for anyone interested. These audit records guarantee the properties of immutable history for anyone to verify should they want to while preserving the privacy of all users in the directory.\\n\\nThis does not risk anyone’s actual info from being public, nor does it reveal any patterns of behavior for any users. You can read more about how this privacy guarantee works as outlined inSEEMlessandParakeet, the academic works from which key transparency is based off.\\n\\n## WhatsApp’s key transparency rollout\\n\\nKey transparency solutions help strengthen the guarantee that end-to-end encryption provides to private personal messaging applications in a transparent manner available to all. This technology underpins WhatsApp commitment and leadership in the security domain.\\n\\nWhatsApp is already hosting and operating an AKD for all of our users, regardless of the version or platform of the application you’re utilizing. Users who utilize the verify security code function will start to notice that the verification is automatic as this rolls out on Android in the coming months.* This is an important mechanism that empowers security-conscious users to verify an end-to-end encrypted personal conversation quickly.\\n\\n## Read the whitepaper\\n\\nRead theWhatsApp Key Transparency Overview whitepaperfor a more technical deep-dive that goes through potential attacks, additional details on data-flows, and formats.\\n\\n*UPDATE: Key Transparency is now fully available on WhatsApp for Android and iOS.\\n\\n### Share this:\\n\\n* Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook\\n* Click to share on Threads (Opens in new window)Threads\\n* Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X\\n* Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)LinkedIn\\n* Click to share on Hacker News (Opens in new window)Hacker News\\n* Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Email', 'title': 'Deploying key transparency at WhatsApp', 'url': 'https://engineering.fb.com/2023/04/13/security/whatsapp-key-transparency/'}]\n\nUSER'S SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n**Critically important: You must integrate the following user-specific directives into the email. These instructions override any conflicting general advice.**\nI’m partially blind and I have a guide dog\n\n\n------\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. **FIND COMMON GROUND (OR CREATE IT)**: Analyze the recruiter's background deeply to identify shared elements.\n   - Primary targets: Same university, previous companies, mutual connections, shared professional groups.\n   - **Fallback strategy**: If no direct common ground exists, identify a specific, non-generic aspect of their career you genuinely admire (e.g., an article they wrote, a talk they gave, their transition from one industry to another).\n\n2. **LEAD WITH A STRATEGIC SUBJECT LINE**: Create a subject line that is both professional and intriguing, ideally hinting at the common ground or a key value proposition. *Example: \"Fellow [University Name] Alum & Data Scientist\" or \"Question about your work at [Previous Company]\"*.\n\n3. **LEAD WITH CONNECTION**: Start the email's first sentence by mentioning the most compelling commonality naturally. Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

This underpins our key transparency deployment.\\n\\nEnd-to-end encryption is the foundation of private messaging on WhatsApp, helping to ensure that only you and the person you’re communicating with can read what’s sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp. It is among the most widely used deployments of end-to-end encryption and relies on public key cryptography first developed in the 1970s. From a technical point of view, for end-to-end encryption to be trusted, the “ends” of a conversation need to know that one another’s encryption keys are authentic and valid.\\n\\nTo do so, our most security conscious users have always been able to take advantage of oursecurity code verification featureavailable under a user’s contact info. When in person, keys can be validated with a quick QR code scan or, if remote, sharing the unique 60-digit code.\\n\\nThis is the one of the strongest ways of verifying if a connection is secure. But in reality we know that double checking a long code is cumbersome, and our team has been looking at ways to make this easier for some time.\\n\\nWe’re excited to introduce a new cryptographic security feature to automatically verify a secure connection without the need for this long code. To do so, we’re building on key transparency by developing a newAuditable Key Directory (AKD), which is based on anopen-sourced library. The AKD will enable WhatsApp clients to automatically validate that a user’s encryption key is genuine and enables anyone to verify audit proofs of the directory’s correctness.\\n\\nOur approach to key transparency is two-pronged and introduces two new components:\\n\\n1. The server (WhatsApp) maintains an append-only AKD of public keys mapped to user accounts.\\n1. A third-party audit record, wherein any change in the server directory is recorded in a publicly available, privacy-preserving audit record for anyone to verify.\\n\\nWith these two additions, users can automatically verify their conversation security thanks to the WhatsApp directory. As this is rolled out, security-conscious users who utilize the verify security code page will notice this verification process occurs quickly and automatically.\\n\\nThis system is a new service provided by WhatsApp that relies on public auditing to verify the end-to-end encryption status of personal conversations. While this system provides easy and convenient verification tools to our users, those who wish to verify their end-to-end encrypted sessions without utilizing WhatsApp servers at all are encouraged to utilize the traditional security code verification process in addition to this new automated process.\\n\\nThe public keys are only a tool that users have to encrypt their messages. The private key – which is used to decrypt messages – is on user devices. Nobody – not even WhatsApp – has access to those private keys. A list of public keys alone cannot provide access to anyone’s content.\\n\\n## How the “Verify Security Code” page works\\n\\nThe crux of end-to-end encrypted messaging is public/private key pairs. The private key is what you utilize to decrypt your messages sent from another party and never leaves your device. The public key, however, is what you give to others so they can encrypt messages. This is done by first giving the key to WhatsApp, where we store it on your behalf and give it to users who wish to message you.\\n\\nThe classic concern that end-to-end encryption was designed to guard against is a person-in-the-middle attack where youthinkyou’re talking to just one user; however, you’re actually talking to a middle-man attacker, who provides an incorrect public key so that they hold the private key and can read your messages. The attacker may then use the correct public key for your contact, re-encrypt the message with it, and send it to the user.What stops this today? WhatsApp has aSecurity Pagefor each contact that has a QR code and a 60-digit number that can be verified outside of WhatsApp to make sure it matches what your contact sees on their device. In short, it’s a unique hash of both your public keys and their public keys, so if either of you have the wrong value, the hashes won’t match. When they do match this confirms a secure, end-to-end encrypted conversation.\\n\\n## What’s the problem key transparency is fixing?\\n\\nWhile providing a strong guarantee of security, the QR code scanning/number matching feature requires communicating with your contacts outside of WhatsApp – whether it’s over a video-call, in real-life, on the phone, etc. This is:\\n\\n1. Difficult to do in 1:1 communications, especially as users change devices (and therefore encryption keys) over time;\\n1. Even harder in small groups, since eachpairof participants has a unique code (there are no “group” codes);\\n1. Is near-impossible to perform in large groups. Every time someone joins or leaves, enrolls a new companion device, changes their phone, etc. this needs to be redone for all participants. For example, in a group of 100 people, that’s 4950 pairs of security verifications.\\n\\nIdeally, this wouldn’t be a manual process and could be verified through some kind of automated flow.\\n\\nEnterkeytransparency: Aprotocol in which we establish an AKD on WhatsApp that maintains a record of public key changes. Additionally, we’ve established a third-party public repository of auditable change logs to the directory that updates whenever there’s additions to the directory. This is vital for transparency and to further strengthen our end-to-end encrypted guarantee. In effect, this confirms that the same public keys a user uses to contact a recipient are the same ones that everybody else also uses to communicate with the recipient.\\n\\nAlthough key transparency does not substitute QR code scanning, it enhances and complements it in the following ways:\\n\\n1. QR code scanning requires two people to coordinate out-of-band verification. In contrast, key transparency requires only a single client to initiate and perform a check against the directory, thus improving accessibility of the check process;\\n1. Key transparency serves as a public key consistency mechanism when manual QR code verification is impractical (for example in large group communication scenario);\\n1. It also serves as a lightweight first-check of end-to-end encryption, which improves adoption of end-to-end encryption checks to more users, benefiting messaging security at-large.\\n\\nIn the event that the automatic check returns a result showing that the connection may not be secure, we recommend users proceed with the manual security verification check.\\n\\n## The history of key transparency\\n\\nKey transparency describes a protocol in which the server maintains an append-only record of the mapping between a user’s account and their public identity key.This allows the generation ofinclusionproofs to assert that a given mapping exists in the directory at the time of the most recent update.\\n\\nWhatsApp’s realization of key transparency is based on the original academic works on key transparency, starting withCONIKSandSEEMless, with extensions from a recent paper calledParakeet. Together, this resulted in the RustAKDcrate, which serves as the foundation for maintaining a key transparency solution along with generating inclusion and key history proofs from the directory. WhatsApp is hosting this AKD directory as an infrastructure available to all of our users.\\n\\nPublic keys cannot be used to decrypt a user’s messages or determine who you’ve been talking to. They are, however, necessary to make sure that someone is sending a message to the intended recipient by encrypting messages that only the holder of the public key’s associated private key can read.\\n\\nA user may have many entries as they update their key over time. At WhatsApp’s scale this equates to billions of entries continually growing over time. When a user deletes their account, we remove all of the public keys for that account, but the fact a key existed at a point in time is immutable (we just can’t say what the key was).\\n\\n## How does key transparency work?\\n\\n### Security on principle\\n\\nFrom a core design choice, multiple factors helped us decide to enhance the openness and security of this project.First off, the AKD, with all of its proof generation and verification logic, is open-source code.This is aRust-based crate (library) for any entity that wants to manage an append-only directory with a publicly verifiable log or verify append-only audit proofs and participate as a public auditor of WhatsApp’s key transparency solution. A list of public keys alone cannot provide access to anyone’s content.\\n\\nThis library allows for the system to provide a significant guarantee on the correctness of the directory entries while not compromising security by being vulnerable to memory-based attacks. Additionally, we stuck with the decision to utilize Rust in most of the internal components outlined below.\\n\\n## Applying AKD to WhatsApp\\n\\n### High-volume key changes\\n\\nWhatsApp deals with tens of thousands of key changes (registration, re-registration, etc.) per minute. This kind of volume is difficult to deal with when trying to insert into an append-only log.\\n\\nTherefore, we decided to implement a distributed, high-throughput queue where “pending changes” live prior to being gathered together into a batch and inserted to form the next epoch. This allows us to do far larger batch inserts and greatly limits the number of database operations we need to make.\\n\\nSince the changes to the AKD are additive based on the previousepochwe need to make sure that only a single update occurs at a time. A single processor, sequentially handling each update one-by-one, wouldn’t be able to keep up with the rate of changes within WhatsApp (no matter the database implementation). This adds some latency from the time a key is added or updated to when it’s “published” in the directory.\\n\\nBy batching keys together and making anepocha collection of changes committed atomically, we can benefit from a lot of query optimizations due to many shared paths in the Merkle Tree stored in the database. The frequency to publish and emit newepochsis a tunable parameter that may be adjusted over time.\\n\\n### Public auditing at scale\\n\\nThe general requirement for all transparency solutions is to bepublicly auditable, meaning that anyone, should they want to, can verify the transactions on the directory to assert that:\\n\\n1. The history hasn’t been changed (existing records aren’t deleted or updated).\\n1. Changes are append-only.\\n\\nWhen publishing a new change to the AKD, we emit an audit proof of those changes that is put into public storage for anyone interested. These audit records guarantee the properties of immutable history for anyone to verify should they want to while preserving the privacy of all users in the directory.\\n\\nThis does not risk anyone’s actual info from being public, nor does it reveal any patterns of behavior for any users. You can read more about how this privacy guarantee works as outlined inSEEMlessandParakeet, the academic works from which key transparency is based off.\\n\\n## WhatsApp’s key transparency rollout\\n\\nKey transparency solutions help strengthen the guarantee that end-to-end encryption provides to private personal messaging applications in a transparent manner available to all. This technology underpins WhatsApp commitment and leadership in the security domain.\\n\\nWhatsApp is already hosting and operating an AKD for all of our users, regardless of the version or platform of the application you’re utilizing. Users who utilize the verify security code function will start to notice that the verification is automatic as this rolls out on Android in the coming months.* This is an important mechanism that empowers security-conscious users to verify an end-to-end encrypted personal conversation quickly.\\n\\n## Read the whitepaper\\n\\nRead theWhatsApp Key Transparency Overview whitepaperfor a more technical deep-dive that goes through potential attacks, additional details on data-flows, and formats.\\n\\n*UPDATE: Key Transparency is now fully available on WhatsApp for Android and iOS.\\n\\n### Share this:\\n\\n* Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook\\n* Click to share on Threads (Opens in new window)Threads\\n* Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X\\n* Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)LinkedIn\\n* Click to share on Hacker News (Opens in new window)Hacker News\\n* Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Email', 'title': 'Deploying key transparency at WhatsApp', 'url': 'https://engineering.fb.com/2023/04/13/security/whatsapp-key-transparency/'}]\n\nUSER'S SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n**Critically important: You must integrate the following user-specific directives into the email.

Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

verify a secured connection based on key transparency.\\n* The feature requires no additional actions or steps from users and helps ensure that a conversation is secure.\\n* Key transparency solutions help strengthen the guarantee that end-to-end encryption provides to private, personal messaging applications in a transparent manner available to all.\\n* We have published an open-source library calledAuditable Key Directory (AKD). This enables anyone to verify audit proofs of the directory’s correctness. This underpins our key transparency deployment.\\n\\nEnd-to-end encryption is the foundation of private messaging on WhatsApp, helping to ensure that only you and the person you’re communicating with can read what’s sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp. It is among the most widely used deployments of end-to-end encryption and relies on public key cryptography first developed in the 1970s. From a technical point of view, for end-to-end encryption to be trusted, the “ends” of a conversation need to know that one another’s encryption keys are authentic and valid.\\n\\nTo do so, our most security conscious users have always been able to take advantage of oursecurity code verification featureavailable under a user’s contact info. When in person, keys can be validated with a quick QR code scan or, if remote, sharing the unique 60-digit code.\\n\\nThis is the one of the strongest ways of verifying if a connection is secure. But in reality we know that double checking a long code is cumbersome, and our team has been looking at ways to make this easier for some time.\\n\\nWe’re excited to introduce a new cryptographic security feature to automatically verify a secure connection without the need for this long code. To do so, we’re building on key transparency by developing a newAuditable Key Directory (AKD), which is based on anopen-sourced library. The AKD will enable WhatsApp clients to automatically validate that a user’s encryption key is genuine and enables anyone to verify audit proofs of the directory’s correctness.\\n\\nOur approach to key transparency is two-pronged and introduces two new components:\\n\\n1. The server (WhatsApp) maintains an append-only AKD of public keys mapped to user accounts.\\n1. A third-party audit record, wherein any change in the server directory is recorded in a publicly available, privacy-preserving audit record for anyone to verify.\\n\\nWith these two additions, users can automatically verify their conversation security thanks to the WhatsApp directory. As this is rolled out, security-conscious users who utilize the verify security code page will notice this verification process occurs quickly and automatically.\\n\\nThis system is a new service provided by WhatsApp that relies on public auditing to verify the end-to-end encryption status of personal conversations. While this system provides easy and convenient verification tools to our users, those who wish to verify their end-to-end encrypted sessions without utilizing WhatsApp servers at all are encouraged to utilize the traditional security code verification process in addition to this new automated process.\\n\\nThe public keys are only a tool that users have to encrypt their messages. The private key – which is used to decrypt messages – is on user devices. Nobody – not even WhatsApp – has access to those private keys. A list of public keys alone cannot provide access to anyone’s content.\\n\\n## How the “Verify Security Code” page works\\n\\nThe crux of end-to-end encrypted messaging is public/private key pairs. The private key is what you utilize to decrypt your messages sent from another party and never leaves your device. The public key, however, is what you give to others so they can encrypt messages. This is done by first giving the key to WhatsApp, where we store it on your behalf and give it to users who wish to message you.\\n\\nThe classic concern that end-to-end encryption was designed to guard against is a person-in-the-middle attack where youthinkyou’re talking to just one user; however, you’re actually talking to a middle-man attacker, who provides an incorrect public key so that they hold the private key and can read your messages. The attacker may then use the correct public key for your contact, re-encrypt the message with it, and send it to the user.What stops this today? WhatsApp has aSecurity Pagefor each contact that has a QR code and a 60-digit number that can be verified outside of WhatsApp to make sure it matches what your contact sees on their device. In short, it’s a unique hash of both your public keys and their public keys, so if either of you have the wrong value, the hashes won’t match. When they do match this confirms a secure, end-to-end encrypted conversation.\\n\\n## What’s the problem key transparency is fixing?\\n\\nWhile providing a strong guarantee of security, the QR code scanning/number matching feature requires communicating with your contacts outside of WhatsApp – whether it’s over a video-call, in real-life, on the phone, etc. This is:\\n\\n1. Difficult to do in 1:1 communications, especially as users change devices (and therefore encryption keys) over time;\\n1. Even harder in small groups, since eachpairof participants has a unique code (there are no “group” codes);\\n1. Is near-impossible to perform in large groups. Every time someone joins or leaves, enrolls a new companion device, changes their phone, etc. this needs to be redone for all participants. For example, in a group of 100 people, that’s 4950 pairs of security verifications.\\n\\nIdeally, this wouldn’t be a manual process and could be verified through some kind of automated flow.\\n\\nEnterkeytransparency: Aprotocol in which we establish an AKD on WhatsApp that maintains a record of public key changes. Additionally, we’ve established a third-party public repository of auditable change logs to the directory that updates whenever there’s additions to the directory. This is vital for transparency and to further strengthen our end-to-end encrypted guarantee. In effect, this confirms that the same public keys a user uses to contact a recipient are the same ones that everybody else also uses to communicate with the recipient.\\n\\nAlthough key transparency does not substitute QR code scanning, it enhances and complements it in the following ways:\\n\\n1. QR code scanning requires two people to coordinate out-of-band verification. In contrast, key transparency requires only a single client to initiate and perform a check against the directory, thus improving accessibility of the check process;\\n1. Key transparency serves as a public key consistency mechanism when manual QR code verification is impractical (for example in large group communication scenario);\\n1. It also serves as a lightweight first-check of end-to-end encryption, which improves adoption of end-to-end encryption checks to more users, benefiting messaging security at-large.\\n\\nIn the event that the automatic check returns a result showing that the connection may not be secure, we recommend users proceed with the manual security verification check.\\n\\n## The history of key transparency\\n\\nKey transparency describes a protocol in which the server maintains an append-only record of the mapping between a user’s account and their public identity key.This allows the generation ofinclusionproofs to assert that a given mapping exists in the directory at the time of the most recent update.\\n\\nWhatsApp’s realization of key transparency is based on the original academic works on key transparency, starting withCONIKSandSEEMless, with extensions from a recent paper calledParakeet. Together, this resulted in the RustAKDcrate, which serves as the foundation for maintaining a key transparency solution along with generating inclusion and key history proofs from the directory. WhatsApp is hosting this AKD directory as an infrastructure available to all of our users.\\n\\nPublic keys cannot be used to decrypt a user’s messages or determine who you’ve been talking to. They are, however, necessary to make sure that someone is sending a message to the intended recipient by encrypting messages that only the holder of the public key’s associated private key can read.\\n\\nA user may have many entries as they update their key over time. At WhatsApp’s scale this equates to billions of entries continually growing over time. When a user deletes their account, we remove all of the public keys for that account, but the fact a key existed at a point in time is immutable (we just can’t say what the key was).\\n\\n## How does key transparency work?\\n\\n### Security on principle\\n\\nFrom a core design choice, multiple factors helped us decide to enhance the openness and security of this project.First off, the AKD, with all of its proof generation and verification logic, is open-source code.This is aRust-based crate (library) for any entity that wants to manage an append-only directory with a publicly verifiable log or verify append-only audit proofs and participate as a public auditor of WhatsApp’s key transparency solution. A list of public keys alone cannot provide access to anyone’s content.\\n\\nThis library allows for the system to provide a significant guarantee on the correctness of the directory entries while not compromising security by being vulnerable to memory-based attacks. Additionally, we stuck with the decision to utilize Rust in most of the internal components outlined below.\\n\\n## Applying AKD to WhatsApp\\n\\n### High-volume key changes\\n\\nWhatsApp deals with tens of thousands of key changes (registration, re-registration, etc.) per minute. This kind of volume is difficult to deal with when trying to insert into an append-only log.\\n\\nTherefore, we decided to implement a distributed, high-throughput queue where “pending changes” live prior to being gathered together into a batch and inserted to form the next epoch. This allows us to do far larger batch inserts and greatly limits the number of database operations we need to make.\\n\\nSince the changes to the AKD are additive based on the previousepochwe need to make sure that only a single update occurs at a time. A single processor, sequentially handling each update one-by-one, wouldn’t be able to keep up with the rate of changes within WhatsApp (no matter the database implementation). This adds some latency from the time a key is added or updated to when it’s “published” in the directory.\\n\\nBy batching keys together and making anepocha collection of changes committed atomically, we can benefit from a lot of query optimizations due to many shared paths in the Merkle Tree stored in the database. The frequency to publish and emit newepochsis a tunable parameter that may be adjusted over time.\\n\\n### Public auditing at scale\\n\\nThe general requirement for all transparency solutions is to bepublicly auditable, meaning that anyone, should they want to, can verify the transactions on the directory to assert that:\\n\\n1. The history hasn’t been changed (existing records aren’t deleted or updated).\\n1. Changes are append-only.\\n\\nWhen publishing a new change to the AKD, we emit an audit proof of those changes that is put into public storage for anyone interested. These audit records guarantee the properties of immutable history for anyone to verify should they want to while preserving the privacy of all users in the directory.\\n\\nThis does not risk anyone’s actual info from being public, nor does it reveal any patterns of behavior for any users. You can read more about how this privacy guarantee works as outlined inSEEMlessandParakeet, the academic works from which key transparency is based off.\\n\\n## WhatsApp’s key transparency rollout\\n\\nKey transparency solutions help strengthen the guarantee that end-to-end encryption provides to private personal messaging applications in a transparent manner available to all. This technology underpins WhatsApp commitment and leadership in the security domain.\\n\\nWhatsApp is already hosting and operating an AKD for all of our users, regardless of the version or platform of the application you’re utilizing. Users who utilize the verify security code function will start to notice that the verification is automatic as this rolls out on Android in the coming months.* This is an important mechanism that empowers security-conscious users to verify an end-to-end encrypted personal conversation quickly.\\n\\n## Read the whitepaper\\n\\nRead theWhatsApp Key Transparency Overview whitepaperfor a more technical deep-dive that goes through potential attacks, additional details on data-flows, and formats.\\n\\n*UPDATE: Key Transparency is now fully available on WhatsApp for Android and iOS.\\n\\n### Share this:\\n\\n* Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook\\n* Click to share on Threads (Opens in new window)Threads\\n* Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X\\n* Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)LinkedIn\\n* Click to share on Hacker News (Opens in new window)Hacker News\\n* Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Email', 'title': 'Deploying key transparency at WhatsApp', 'url': 'https://engineering.fb.com/2023/04/13/security/whatsapp-key-transparency/'}]\n\nUSER'S SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n**Critically important: You must integrate the following user-specific directives into the email. These instructions override any conflicting general advice.**\nI’m partially blind and I have a guide dog\n\n\n------\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. **FIND COMMON GROUND (OR CREATE IT)**: Analyze the recruiter's background deeply to identify shared elements.\n   - Primary targets: Same university, previous companies, mutual connections, shared professional groups.\n   - **Fallback strategy**: If no direct common ground exists, identify a specific, non-generic aspect of their career you genuinely admire (e.g., an article they wrote, a talk they gave, their transition from one industry to another).\n\n2. **LEAD WITH A STRATEGIC SUBJECT LINE**: Create a subject line that is both professional and intriguing, ideally hinting at the common ground or a key value proposition. *Example: \"Fellow [University Name] Alum & Data Scientist\" or \"Question about your work at [Previous Company]\"*.\n\n3. **LEAD WITH CONNECTION**: Start the email's first sentence by mentioning the most compelling commonality naturally. Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

design and engineering effort, spanning half a decade, that combines the unique strengths of Apple silicon hardware with our advanced operating system security to provide industry-first, always-on memory safety protection across our devices — without compromising our best-in-class device performance. We believe Memory Integrity Enforcement represents the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems.\\n\\nThere has never been a successful, widespread malware attack against iPhone. The only system-level iOS attacks we observe in the wild come from mercenary spyware, which is vastly more complex than regular cybercriminal activity and consumer malware. Mercenary spyware is historically associated with state actors and uses exploit chains that cost millions of dollars to target a very small number of specific individuals and their devices. Although the vast majority of users will never be targeted in this way, these exploit chains demonstrate some of the most expensive, complex, and advanced attacker capabilities at any given time and are uniquely deserving of study as we work to protect iPhone users against even the most sophisticated threats. Known mercenary spyware chains used against iOS share a common denominator with those targeting Windows and Android: they exploit memory safety vulnerabilities, which are interchangeable, powerful, and exist throughout the industry.\\n\\nFor Apple, improving memory safety is a broad effort that includes developing with safe languages and deploying mitigations at scale. (For a primer on how we think about memory safety, see the opening ofthis post.) We created Swift, an easy-to-use, memory-safe language, which we employ for new code and targeted component rewrites. In iOS 15, we introducedkalloc_type, a secure memory allocator for the kernel, followed in iOS 17 by its user-level counterpart, xzone malloc. These secure allocators take advantage of knowing the type — or purpose — of allocations so that memory can be organized in a way that makes exploiting most memory corruption vulnerabilities inherently difficult.\\n\\nIn 2018, we were the first in the industry to deploy Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC) in the A12 Bionic chip, to protect code flow integrity in the presence of memory corruption. The strong success of this defensive mechanism in increasing exploitation complexity left no doubt that the deep integration of software and hardware security would be key to addressing some of our greatest security challenges. With PAC behind us, we immediately began design and evaluation work to find the most effective way to build sophisticated memory safety capabilities right into Apple silicon.\\n\\nArm published theMemory Tagging Extension (MTE)specification in 2019 as a tool for hardware to help find memory corruption bugs. MTE is, at its core, a memory tagging and tag-checking system, where every memory allocation is tagged with a secret; the hardware guarantees that later requests to access memory are granted only if the request contains the correct secret. If the secrets don’t match, the app crashes, and the event is logged. This allows developers to identify memory corruption bugs immediately as they occur.\\n\\nWe conducted a deep evaluation and research process to determine whether MTE, as designed, would meet our goals for hardware-assisted memory safety. Our analysis found that, when employed as a real-time defensive measure, the original Arm MTE release exhibited weaknesses that were unacceptable to us, and we worked with Arm to address these shortcomings in the newEnhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE)specification, released in 2022. More importantly, our analysis showed that while EMTE had great potential as specified, a rigorous implementation with deep hardware and operating system support could be a breakthrough that produces an extraordinary new security mechanism.\\n\\nConsider that MTE can beconfiguredto report memory corruption either synchronously or asynchronously. In the latter mode, memory corruption doesn’t immediately raise an exception, leaving a race window open for attackers. We would not implement such a mechanism. We believe memory safety protections need to be strictly synchronous, on by default, and working continuously. But supporting always-on, synchronous MTE across key attack surfaces while preserving a great, high-performance user experience is extremely demanding on hardware.\\n\\nIn addition, for MTE to provide memory safety in an adversarial context, we would need to finely tune the operating system to defend the new semantics and the confidentiality of memory tags on which MTE relies. Ultimately, we determined that to deliver truly best-in-class memory safety, we would carry out a massive engineering effort spanning all of Apple — including updates to Apple silicon, our operating systems, and our software frameworks. This effort, together with our highly successful secure memory allocator work, would transform MTE from a helpful debugging tool into a groundbreaking new security feature.\\n\\nToday we’re introducing the culmination of this effort: Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE), our comprehensive memory safety defense for Apple platforms. Memory Integrity Enforcement is built on the robust foundation provided by oursecure memory allocators, coupled withEnhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE)in synchronous mode, and supported by extensiveTag Confidentiality Enforcementpolicies. MIE is built right into Apple hardware and software in all models of iPhone 17 and iPhone Air and offers unparalleled, always-on memory safety protection for our key attack surfaces including the kernel, while maintaining the power and performance that users expect. In addition, we’re making EMTE available to all Apple developers in Xcode as part of the newEnhanced Securityfeature that we released earlier this year during WWDC.\\n\\nThe rest of this post dives into the intensive engineering effort required to design and validate Memory Integrity Enforcement.\\n\\n### Designing Memory Integrity Enforcement\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement starts with our secure memory allocators — kalloc_type, xzone malloc, and WebKit’s libpas — all of which usetype informationto decide how to organize memory allocations. With both use-after-free and out-of-bounds bugs, an attacker’s goal is to create overlapping interpretations of memory, which they achieve by controlling the precise position of certain allocations — of a specific type — that is advantageous to them. The type-aware placement policies of our secure memory allocators help thwart these memory corruption techniques, as we described in ourkalloc_type post. Our secure allocators set a new high-water mark of software protection against memory corruption, while preserving the same or better performance as the allocators they replaced.\\n\\nAllocators can apply protections only at the granularity of memory pages — 16KB on iOS — which is a natural fit for multi-page allocations. For smaller allocations, our secure allocators can use page-level protections to help prevent memory corruption attacks across different type buckets. However, page-level protections are too coarse to defend against attacks within the same type bucket, and we use memory tagging to close this gap.\\n\\nLet’s look at how EMTE can be used to protect against two of the most common types of memory corruption: buffer overflows and use-after-free vulnerabilities. For buffer overflows, the allocator is responsible for using different tags for neighboring allocations. If a request to access memory spills over to adjacent memory that has a different tag, the hardware blocks it, and the operating system can take action and terminate the process. We represent this visually below with three adjacent allocations, tagged with three different secrets: ⏺️, 🔼, and ⏹️. Two access attempts with the 🔼 tag are permitted to 🔼-tagged memory, but the third attempt is blocked as it spills over into the adjacent, ⏹️-tagged allocation.\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement blocks buffer overflows\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement blocks buffer overflows\\n\\nThe allocator is also responsible for retagging memory as it gets reused for other purposes. In the image below, the 🔼 allocation is retagged as ⏹️ after it has been freed and reallocated by the system. If a request to the retagged memory is made with the older 🔼 tag, as would be seen in use-after-free exploits, the hardware blocks it and lets the operating system take further action.\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement blocks use-after-free access\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement blocks use-after-free access\\n\\nA key weakness of the original MTE specification is that access to non-tagged memory, such as global variables, is not checked by the hardware. This means attackers don’t have to face as many defensive constraints when attempting to control core application configuration and state. With Enhanced MTE, we instead specify that accessing non-tagged memory from a tagged memory region requires knowing that region’s tag, making it significantly harder for attackers to turn out-of-bounds bugs in dynamic tagged memory into a way to sidestep EMTE by directly modifying non-tagged allocations.\\n\\nFinally, we developedTag Confidentiality Enforcementto protect the implementation of our secure allocators from technical threats and to guard the confidentiality of EMTE tags — including against side-channel and speculative-execution attacks.\\n\\nOur typed allocators and EMTE both rely on confidentiality of kernel data structures from user applications, and of the tags chosen by the allocator. Attackers might attempt to defeat EMTE, and in turn Memory Integrity Enforcement, by revealing these secrets. To protect the kernel allocator backing store and tag storage, we use theSecure Page Table Monitor, which provides strong guarantees even in the presence of a kernel compromise. We also ensure that when the kernel accesses memory on behalf of an application, it's subject to the same tag-checking rules as userspace.\\n\\nAttacks based on speculative execution can also be used to expose secrets. To improve performance, modern CPUs predict the execution of instructions that follow prior, potentially longer latency instructions. If the prediction is correct, computation is very fast. If it’s wrong, the CPU discards the prediction, and computation is slower. Unfortunately, discarded predictions have observable effects that can reveal system state and data, and because speculative attacks never cause the system to crash or misbehave in observable ways during their use, they’re particularly useful for an attacker. For example, evaluating a pointer authentication instruction speculatively exposedtiming differencesin our original implementation of Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC), which would allow the valid signature to be isolated. During the design phase for Memory Integrity Enforcement, we identified and addressed the three speculative vulnerabilities that could undermine tag confidentiality.\\n\\nFirst, when EMTE is active, requests to access memory cause the hardware to check tags. It's crucial that evaluating a tag-checking instruction speculatively doesn’t expose timing differences that would allow an attacker to isolate the valid tag. From the start, we designed the Apple silicon implementation so that tag values can’t influence speculative execution in any way.  Recently published security research (StickyTags,TikTag) demonstrates that the MTE implementation on Google’s Pixel devices is vulnerable to this type of attack, allowing MTE to be bypassed in Google Chrome and the Linux kernel.\\n\\nSecond, allocators assign random tags to memory, and attackers must not be able to predict tag values that the system will choose. We address this issue by frequently re-seeding the underlying pseudo-random generator used to select new tags.\\n\\nThird,Spectre variant 1 (V1)is a speculative-execution vulnerability that allows attackers to exploit conditional branches to leak data, including MTE tag values. To date, there has been no solution to this problem in consumer operating systems, because general Spectre V1 mitigations such asSpeculative Load Hardeninghave a prohibitive CPU cost. The presence of EMTE leaves Spectre V1 as one of the last avenues available to attackers to help guide their attacks, so we designed a mitigation that limits the effective reach of Spectre V1 leaks at virtually zero CPU cost. This mitigation forces attackers to contend with type segregation, through ideas similar to VUSec’sTDI, making it impractical to exploit Spectre V1. The result is that attackers would typically need 25 or more V1 sequences to reach more than 95 percent exploitability rate — unless one of these sequences is related to the bug being exploited, following similar reasoning as ourkalloc_type analysis.\\n\\nOur mission with Memory Integrity Enforcement is to protect all users by default and provide an extraordinary disruption to the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities. To do so, we considered a wide set of threats, including some of the most challenging ones — such as side channels — and arrived at this extensive combination of features not present in other MTE implementations. Google took a great first step last year when they offered MTE to those who opt in to their program for at-risk users. But even for users who turn it on, the effectiveness of MTE on Android is limited by the lack of deep integration with the operating system that distinguishes Memory Integrity Enforcement and its use of EMTE on Apple silicon.\\n\\nFor the new A19 and A19 Pro chips to support Memory Integrity Enforcement, we dedicated an extraordinary amount of Apple silicon resources to security — more than ever before — including CPU area, CPU speed, and memory for tag storage. And to fully realize this hardware investment, we designed all of the new operating system elements of MIE jointly with our hardware work, including secure allocators, EMTE, and tag confidentiality protections.\\n\\nBecause EMTE tag checking imposes a performance cost, we designed Memory Integrity Enforcement to take advantage of our secure allocators first and use EMTE to protect only smaller individual allocations within a type bucket, which software allocators can’t defend on their own. Then, by knowing where and how we would deploy EMTE, we could accurately model the tag-checking demand of the operating system, and design our silicon to satisfy it. Our hardware implementation influenced additional software design decisions, reducing the overhead of tag checks even further. Importantly, deploying EMTE with this level of precision supports our strategy to provide as many memory safety improvements as possible to users on previous iPhone generations, which don’t support EMTE.\\n\\nFor the security evaluation of Memory Integrity Enforcement, we involved our offensive research team from the very beginning. From 2020 to 2025, they continuously analyzed and attacked the system — first conceptually, with theoretical exploitation avenues, then with practical attacks in simulated environments, and eventually on new hardware prototypes. Prolonged engagement from our offensive research team allowed us to identify and eradicate entire attack strategies and techniques before attackers could ever discover them, leading to a stronger, more mature feature from the outset.\\n\\nOur offensive research team identified where and how attackers are most likely to break into the system, and our deployment of Memory Integrity Enforcement is deeply guided by their findings. Notably, this includes making sure that this powerful new protection is available to third-party apps that are likely entry points for attackers — such as social networks, messaging apps, or any other app where a specific user can be targeted. Starting immediately with the launch of MIE, any developer can begin testing this powerful protection for their app, including EMTE on hardware that supports it, using theEnhanced Securitysettings in Xcode.\\n\\nThe meticulous planning and implementation of Memory Integrity Enforcement made it possible to maintain synchronous tag checking for all the demanding workloads of our platforms, delivering groundbreaking security with minimal performance impact, while remaining completely invisible to users.\\n\\n### Security evaluation\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement started with a deeply ambitious goal: to make it immensely more expensive and difficult to develop and maintain mercenary spyware attacks based on memory corruption against our platforms. While there’s no such thing as perfect security, MIE is designed to dramatically constrain attackers and their degrees of freedom during exploitation.\\n\\nThroughout the design and implementation of Memory Integrity Enforcement, our offensive research team evaluated our progress by looking at sophisticated exploit chains that were previously used against our platform, recent vulnerabilities, and our own internal research. First, we worked on rebuilding and adapting previously seen exploit chains to systems protected by MIE. But it’s not sufficient to consider only previous chains that were developed before MIE existed, because attackers will surely adapt in reaction to these new protections. We therefore also evaluated a selection of more recent vulnerabilities that we expected would have the best chance of surviving MIE. For these, we meticulously enumerated all possible exploitation opportunities, similar to our evaluation ofSockPuppet against kalloc_type.\\n\\nBoth approaches revealed the same conclusion: Memory Integrity Enforcement vastly reduces the exploitation strategies available to attackers. Though memory corruption bugs are usually interchangeable, MIE cut off so many exploit steps at a fundamental level that it was not possible to restore the chains by swapping in new bugs. Even with substantial effort, we could not rebuild any of these chains to work around MIE. The few memory corruption effects that remained are unreliable and don’t give attackers sufficient momentum to successfully exploit these bugs.\\n\\nHere’s a visual representation of what this looks like for an attacker. The chart below represents six of the real-world exploit chains that we evaluated and shows the steps where Memory Integrity Enforcement — the secure allocators, EMTE, or both — stops the attack.\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement vs. real-world exploit chains\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement vs. real-world exploit chains\\n\\nNotably, attackers confront Memory Integrity Enforcement early in the exploitation process. Although some issues are able to survive MIE — for example, intra-allocation buffer overflows — such issues are extremely rare, and even fewer will lend themselves to a full end-to-end exploit. Inevitably, attackers must face MIE at a stage where their capabilities are still very limited, leaving few viable avenues for exploitation. This leads to fragile chains where breaking just one step is often enough to invalidate the entire exploit strategy. When that happens, most of the chain’s components can’t be reused, and the attackers have to restart exploit development with entirely new bugs.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe industry-leading security of iPhone means that the vast majority of our users never face system-level attacks on their devices. Our work on memory safety is aimed primarily at the mercenary spyware and surveillance industry, which spends many millions of dollars to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities and target a small number of individuals because of who they are and what they do. Over the past five years, we developed a comprehensive approach to memory safety that integrates the best of our hardware and software capabilities, and today’s announcement is the culmination of this ambitious vision. With the introduction of the iPhone 17 lineup and iPhone Air, we’re excited to deliver Memory Integrity Enforcement: the industry’s first ever, comprehensive, always-on memory-safety protection covering key attack surfaces — including the kernel and over 70 userland processes — built on the Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE) and supported by secure typed allocators and tag confidentiality protections.\\n\\nBased on our evaluations pitting Memory Integrity Enforcement against exceptionally sophisticated mercenary spyware attacks from the last three years, we believe MIE will make exploit chains significantly more expensive and difficult to develop and maintain, disrupt many of the most effective exploitation techniques from the last 25 years, and completely redefine the landscape of memory safety for Apple products. Because of how dramatically it reduces an attacker’s ability to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities on our devices, we believe Memory Integrity Enforcement represents the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems.\", 'title': 'Memory Integrity Enforcement: A complete vision for memory safety in Apple devices - Apple Security Research', 'url': 'https://security.apple.com/blog/memory-integrity-enforcement/'}, {'markdown': '# Apple expands industry-leading commitment to protect users from highly targeted mercenary spyware\\n\\n* Messages: Most message attachment types other than images are blocked.

design and engineering effort, spanning half a decade, that combines the unique strengths of Apple silicon hardware with our advanced operating system security to provide industry-first, always-on memory safety protection across our devices — without compromising our best-in-class device performance. We believe Memory Integrity Enforcement represents the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems.\\n\\nThere has never been a successful, widespread malware attack against iPhone. The only system-level iOS attacks we observe in the wild come from mercenary spyware, which is vastly more complex than regular cybercriminal activity and consumer malware. Mercenary spyware is historically associated with state actors and uses exploit chains that cost millions of dollars to target a very small number of specific individuals and their devices. Although the vast majority of users will never be targeted in this way, these exploit chains demonstrate some of the most expensive, complex, and advanced attacker capabilities at any given time and are uniquely deserving of study as we work to protect iPhone users against even the most sophisticated threats. Known mercenary spyware chains used against iOS share a common denominator with those targeting Windows and Android: they exploit memory safety vulnerabilities, which are interchangeable, powerful, and exist throughout the industry.\\n\\nFor Apple, improving memory safety is a broad effort that includes developing with safe languages and deploying mitigations at scale. (For a primer on how we think about memory safety, see the opening ofthis post.) We created Swift, an easy-to-use, memory-safe language, which we employ for new code and targeted component rewrites. In iOS 15, we introducedkalloc_type, a secure memory allocator for the kernel, followed in iOS 17 by its user-level counterpart, xzone malloc. These secure allocators take advantage of knowing the type — or purpose — of allocations so that memory can be organized in a way that makes exploiting most memory corruption vulnerabilities inherently difficult.\\n\\nIn 2018, we were the first in the industry to deploy Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC) in the A12 Bionic chip, to protect code flow integrity in the presence of memory corruption. The strong success of this defensive mechanism in increasing exploitation complexity left no doubt that the deep integration of software and hardware security would be key to addressing some of our greatest security challenges. With PAC behind us, we immediately began design and evaluation work to find the most effective way to build sophisticated memory safety capabilities right into Apple silicon.\\n\\nArm published theMemory Tagging Extension (MTE)specification in 2019 as a tool for hardware to help find memory corruption bugs. MTE is, at its core, a memory tagging and tag-checking system, where every memory allocation is tagged with a secret; the hardware guarantees that later requests to access memory are granted only if the request contains the correct secret. If the secrets don’t match, the app crashes, and the event is logged. This allows developers to identify memory corruption bugs immediately as they occur.\\n\\nWe conducted a deep evaluation and research process to determine whether MTE, as designed, would meet our goals for hardware-assisted memory safety. Our analysis found that, when employed as a real-time defensive measure, the original Arm MTE release exhibited weaknesses that were unacceptable to us, and we worked with Arm to address these shortcomings in the newEnhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE)specification, released in 2022. More importantly, our analysis showed that while EMTE had great potential as specified, a rigorous implementation with deep hardware and operating system support could be a breakthrough that produces an extraordinary new security mechanism.\\n\\nConsider that MTE can beconfiguredto report memory corruption either synchronously or asynchronously. In the latter mode, memory corruption doesn’t immediately raise an exception, leaving a race window open for attackers. We would not implement such a mechanism. We believe memory safety protections need to be strictly synchronous, on by default, and working continuously. But supporting always-on, synchronous MTE across key attack surfaces while preserving a great, high-performance user experience is extremely demanding on hardware.\\n\\nIn addition, for MTE to provide memory safety in an adversarial context, we would need to finely tune the operating system to defend the new semantics and the confidentiality of memory tags on which MTE relies. Ultimately, we determined that to deliver truly best-in-class memory safety, we would carry out a massive engineering effort spanning all of Apple — including updates to Apple silicon, our operating systems, and our software frameworks. This effort, together with our highly successful secure memory allocator work, would transform MTE from a helpful debugging tool into a groundbreaking new security feature.\\n\\nToday we’re introducing the culmination of this effort: Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE), our comprehensive memory safety defense for Apple platforms. Memory Integrity Enforcement is built on the robust foundation provided by oursecure memory allocators, coupled withEnhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE)in synchronous mode, and supported by extensiveTag Confidentiality Enforcementpolicies. MIE is built right into Apple hardware and software in all models of iPhone 17 and iPhone Air and offers unparalleled, always-on memory safety protection for our key attack surfaces including the kernel, while maintaining the power and performance that users expect. In addition, we’re making EMTE available to all Apple developers in Xcode as part of the newEnhanced Securityfeature that we released earlier this year during WWDC.\\n\\nThe rest of this post dives into the intensive engineering effort required to design and validate Memory Integrity Enforcement.\\n\\n### Designing Memory Integrity Enforcement\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement starts with our secure memory allocators — kalloc_type, xzone malloc, and WebKit’s libpas — all of which usetype informationto decide how to organize memory allocations. With both use-after-free and out-of-bounds bugs, an attacker’s goal is to create overlapping interpretations of memory, which they achieve by controlling the precise position of certain allocations — of a specific type — that is advantageous to them. The type-aware placement policies of our secure memory allocators help thwart these memory corruption techniques, as we described in ourkalloc_type post. Our secure allocators set a new high-water mark of software protection against memory corruption, while preserving the same or better performance as the allocators they replaced.\\n\\nAllocators can apply protections only at the granularity of memory pages — 16KB on iOS — which is a natural fit for multi-page allocations. For smaller allocations, our secure allocators can use page-level protections to help prevent memory corruption attacks across different type buckets. However, page-level protections are too coarse to defend against attacks within the same type bucket, and we use memory tagging to close this gap.\\n\\nLet’s look at how EMTE can be used to protect against two of the most common types of memory corruption: buffer overflows and use-after-free vulnerabilities. For buffer overflows, the allocator is responsible for using different tags for neighboring allocations. If a request to access memory spills over to adjacent memory that has a different tag, the hardware blocks it, and the operating system can take action and terminate the process. We represent this visually below with three adjacent allocations, tagged with three different secrets: ⏺️, 🔼, and ⏹️. Two access attempts with the 🔼 tag are permitted to 🔼-tagged memory, but the third attempt is blocked as it spills over into the adjacent, ⏹️-tagged allocation.\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement blocks buffer overflows\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement blocks buffer overflows\\n\\nThe allocator is also responsible for retagging memory as it gets reused for other purposes. In the image below, the 🔼 allocation is retagged as ⏹️ after it has been freed and reallocated by the system. If a request to the retagged memory is made with the older 🔼 tag, as would be seen in use-after-free exploits, the hardware blocks it and lets the operating system take further action.\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement blocks use-after-free access\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement blocks use-after-free access\\n\\nA key weakness of the original MTE specification is that access to non-tagged memory, such as global variables, is not checked by the hardware. This means attackers don’t have to face as many defensive constraints when attempting to control core application configuration and state. With Enhanced MTE, we instead specify that accessing non-tagged memory from a tagged memory region requires knowing that region’s tag, making it significantly harder for attackers to turn out-of-bounds bugs in dynamic tagged memory into a way to sidestep EMTE by directly modifying non-tagged allocations.\\n\\nFinally, we developedTag Confidentiality Enforcementto protect the implementation of our secure allocators from technical threats and to guard the confidentiality of EMTE tags — including against side-channel and speculative-execution attacks.\\n\\nOur typed allocators and EMTE both rely on confidentiality of kernel data structures from user applications, and of the tags chosen by the allocator. Attackers might attempt to defeat EMTE, and in turn Memory Integrity Enforcement, by revealing these secrets. To protect the kernel allocator backing store and tag storage, we use theSecure Page Table Monitor, which provides strong guarantees even in the presence of a kernel compromise. We also ensure that when the kernel accesses memory on behalf of an application, it's subject to the same tag-checking rules as userspace.\\n\\nAttacks based on speculative execution can also be used to expose secrets. To improve performance, modern CPUs predict the execution of instructions that follow prior, potentially longer latency instructions. If the prediction is correct, computation is very fast. If it’s wrong, the CPU discards the prediction, and computation is slower. Unfortunately, discarded predictions have observable effects that can reveal system state and data, and because speculative attacks never cause the system to crash or misbehave in observable ways during their use, they’re particularly useful for an attacker. For example, evaluating a pointer authentication instruction speculatively exposedtiming differencesin our original implementation of Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC), which would allow the valid signature to be isolated. During the design phase for Memory Integrity Enforcement, we identified and addressed the three speculative vulnerabilities that could undermine tag confidentiality.\\n\\nFirst, when EMTE is active, requests to access memory cause the hardware to check tags. It's crucial that evaluating a tag-checking instruction speculatively doesn’t expose timing differences that would allow an attacker to isolate the valid tag. From the start, we designed the Apple silicon implementation so that tag values can’t influence speculative execution in any way.  Recently published security research (StickyTags,TikTag) demonstrates that the MTE implementation on Google’s Pixel devices is vulnerable to this type of attack, allowing MTE to be bypassed in Google Chrome and the Linux kernel.\\n\\nSecond, allocators assign random tags to memory, and attackers must not be able to predict tag values that the system will choose. We address this issue by frequently re-seeding the underlying pseudo-random generator used to select new tags.\\n\\nThird,Spectre variant 1 (V1)is a speculative-execution vulnerability that allows attackers to exploit conditional branches to leak data, including MTE tag values. To date, there has been no solution to this problem in consumer operating systems, because general Spectre V1 mitigations such asSpeculative Load Hardeninghave a prohibitive CPU cost. The presence of EMTE leaves Spectre V1 as one of the last avenues available to attackers to help guide their attacks, so we designed a mitigation that limits the effective reach of Spectre V1 leaks at virtually zero CPU cost. This mitigation forces attackers to contend with type segregation, through ideas similar to VUSec’sTDI, making it impractical to exploit Spectre V1. The result is that attackers would typically need 25 or more V1 sequences to reach more than 95 percent exploitability rate — unless one of these sequences is related to the bug being exploited, following similar reasoning as ourkalloc_type analysis.\\n\\nOur mission with Memory Integrity Enforcement is to protect all users by default and provide an extraordinary disruption to the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities. To do so, we considered a wide set of threats, including some of the most challenging ones — such as side channels — and arrived at this extensive combination of features not present in other MTE implementations. Google took a great first step last year when they offered MTE to those who opt in to their program for at-risk users. But even for users who turn it on, the effectiveness of MTE on Android is limited by the lack of deep integration with the operating system that distinguishes Memory Integrity Enforcement and its use of EMTE on Apple silicon.\\n\\nFor the new A19 and A19 Pro chips to support Memory Integrity Enforcement, we dedicated an extraordinary amount of Apple silicon resources to security — more than ever before — including CPU area, CPU speed, and memory for tag storage. And to fully realize this hardware investment, we designed all of the new operating system elements of MIE jointly with our hardware work, including secure allocators, EMTE, and tag confidentiality protections.\\n\\nBecause EMTE tag checking imposes a performance cost, we designed Memory Integrity Enforcement to take advantage of our secure allocators first and use EMTE to protect only smaller individual allocations within a type bucket, which software allocators can’t defend on their own. Then, by knowing where and how we would deploy EMTE, we could accurately model the tag-checking demand of the operating system, and design our silicon to satisfy it. Our hardware implementation influenced additional software design decisions, reducing the overhead of tag checks even further. Importantly, deploying EMTE with this level of precision supports our strategy to provide as many memory safety improvements as possible to users on previous iPhone generations, which don’t support EMTE.\\n\\nFor the security evaluation of Memory Integrity Enforcement, we involved our offensive research team from the very beginning. From 2020 to 2025, they continuously analyzed and attacked the system — first conceptually, with theoretical exploitation avenues, then with practical attacks in simulated environments, and eventually on new hardware prototypes. Prolonged engagement from our offensive research team allowed us to identify and eradicate entire attack strategies and techniques before attackers could ever discover them, leading to a stronger, more mature feature from the outset.\\n\\nOur offensive research team identified where and how attackers are most likely to break into the system, and our deployment of Memory Integrity Enforcement is deeply guided by their findings. Notably, this includes making sure that this powerful new protection is available to third-party apps that are likely entry points for attackers — such as social networks, messaging apps, or any other app where a specific user can be targeted. Starting immediately with the launch of MIE, any developer can begin testing this powerful protection for their app, including EMTE on hardware that supports it, using theEnhanced Securitysettings in Xcode.\\n\\nThe meticulous planning and implementation of Memory Integrity Enforcement made it possible to maintain synchronous tag checking for all the demanding workloads of our platforms, delivering groundbreaking security with minimal performance impact, while remaining completely invisible to users.\\n\\n### Security evaluation\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement started with a deeply ambitious goal: to make it immensely more expensive and difficult to develop and maintain mercenary spyware attacks based on memory corruption against our platforms. While there’s no such thing as perfect security, MIE is designed to dramatically constrain attackers and their degrees of freedom during exploitation.\\n\\nThroughout the design and implementation of Memory Integrity Enforcement, our offensive research team evaluated our progress by looking at sophisticated exploit chains that were previously used against our platform, recent vulnerabilities, and our own internal research. First, we worked on rebuilding and adapting previously seen exploit chains to systems protected by MIE. But it’s not sufficient to consider only previous chains that were developed before MIE existed, because attackers will surely adapt in reaction to these new protections. We therefore also evaluated a selection of more recent vulnerabilities that we expected would have the best chance of surviving MIE. For these, we meticulously enumerated all possible exploitation opportunities, similar to our evaluation ofSockPuppet against kalloc_type.\\n\\nBoth approaches revealed the same conclusion: Memory Integrity Enforcement vastly reduces the exploitation strategies available to attackers. Though memory corruption bugs are usually interchangeable, MIE cut off so many exploit steps at a fundamental level that it was not possible to restore the chains by swapping in new bugs. Even with substantial effort, we could not rebuild any of these chains to work around MIE. The few memory corruption effects that remained are unreliable and don’t give attackers sufficient momentum to successfully exploit these bugs.\\n\\nHere’s a visual representation of what this looks like for an attacker. The chart below represents six of the real-world exploit chains that we evaluated and shows the steps where Memory Integrity Enforcement — the secure allocators, EMTE, or both — stops the attack.\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement vs. real-world exploit chains\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement vs. real-world exploit chains\\n\\nNotably, attackers confront Memory Integrity Enforcement early in the exploitation process. Although some issues are able to survive MIE — for example, intra-allocation buffer overflows — such issues are extremely rare, and even fewer will lend themselves to a full end-to-end exploit. Inevitably, attackers must face MIE at a stage where their capabilities are still very limited, leaving few viable avenues for exploitation. This leads to fragile chains where breaking just one step is often enough to invalidate the entire exploit strategy. When that happens, most of the chain’s components can’t be reused, and the attackers have to restart exploit development with entirely new bugs.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe industry-leading security of iPhone means that the vast majority of our users never face system-level attacks on their devices. Our work on memory safety is aimed primarily at the mercenary spyware and surveillance industry, which spends many millions of dollars to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities and target a small number of individuals because of who they are and what they do. Over the past five years, we developed a comprehensive approach to memory safety that integrates the best of our hardware and software capabilities, and today’s announcement is the culmination of this ambitious vision. With the introduction of the iPhone 17 lineup and iPhone Air, we’re excited to deliver Memory Integrity Enforcement: the industry’s first ever, comprehensive, always-on memory-safety protection covering key attack surfaces — including the kernel and over 70 userland processes — built on the Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE) and supported by secure typed allocators and tag confidentiality protections.\\n\\nBased on our evaluations pitting Memory Integrity Enforcement against exceptionally sophisticated mercenary spyware attacks from the last three years, we believe MIE will make exploit chains significantly more expensive and difficult to develop and maintain, disrupt many of the most effective exploitation techniques from the last 25 years, and completely redefine the landscape of memory safety for Apple products. Because of how dramatically it reduces an attacker’s ability to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities on our devices, we believe Memory Integrity Enforcement represents the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems.\", 'title': 'Memory Integrity Enforcement: A complete vision for memory safety in Apple devices - Apple Security Research', 'url': 'https://security.apple.com/blog/memory-integrity-enforcement/'}, {'markdown': '# Apple expands industry-leading commitment to protect users from highly targeted mercenary spyware\\n\\n* Messages: Most message attachment types other than images are blocked.

Apple is also providing details of its $10 million grant to bolster research exposing such threats.Apple today detailed two initiatives to help protect users who may be personally targeted by some of the most sophisticated digital threats, such as those from private companies developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware. Lockdown Mode — the first major capability of its kind, coming this fall with iOS 16, iPadOS 16, and macOS Ventura — is an extreme, optional protection for the very small number of users who face grave, targeted threats to their digital security. Apple also shared details about the $10 million cybersecurity grant it announced last November to support civil society organizations that conduct mercenary spyware threat research and advocacy.“Apple makes the most secure mobile devices on the market. Lockdown Mode is a groundbreaking capability that reflects our unwavering commitment to protecting users from even the rarest, most sophisticated attacks,” said Ivan Krstić, Apple’s head of Security Engineering and Architecture. “While the vast majority of users will never be the victims of highly targeted cyberattacks, we will work tirelessly to protect the small number of users who are. That includes continuing to design defenses specifically for these users, as well as supporting researchers and organizations around the world doing critically important work in exposing mercenary companies that create these digital attacks.”Lockdown Mode offers an extreme, optional level of security for the very few users who, because of who they are or what they do, may be personally targeted by some of the most sophisticated digital threats, such as those from NSO Group and other private companies developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware. Turning on Lockdown Mode in iOS 16, iPadOS 16, and macOS Ventura further hardens device defenses and strictly limits certain functionalities, sharply reducing the attack surface that potentially could be exploited by highly targeted mercenary spyware.At launch, Lockdown Mode includes the following protections:Messages: Most message attachment types other than images are blocked. Some features, like link previews, are disabled.Web browsing: Certain complex web technologies, like just-in-time (JIT) JavaScript compilation, are disabled unless the user excludes a trusted site from Lockdown Mode.Apple services: Incoming invitations and service requests, including FaceTime calls, are blocked if the user has not previously sent the initiator a call or request.Wired connections with a computer or accessory are blocked when iPhone is locked.Configuration profiles cannot be installed, and the device cannot enroll into mobile device management (MDM), while Lockdown Mode is turned on.Apple will continue to strengthen Lockdown Mode and add new protections to it over time. To invite feedback and collaboration from the security research community, Apple has also established a new category within the Apple Security Bounty program to reward researchers who find Lockdown Mode bypasses and help improve its protections. Bounties are doubled for qualifying findings in Lockdown Mode, up to a maximum of $2,000,000 — the highest maximum bounty payout in the industry.Apple is also making a $10 million grant, in addition to any damages awarded from the lawsuit filed against NSO Group, to support organizations that investigate, expose, and prevent highly targeted cyberattacks, including those created by private companies developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware. The grant will be made to theDignity and Justice Fundestablished and advised by the Ford Foundation — a private foundation dedicated to advancing equity worldwide — and designed to pool philanthropic resources to advance social justice globally. The Dignity and Justice Fund is a fiscally sponsored project of the New Venture Fund, a 501(c)(3) public charity.“The global spyware trade targets human rights defenders, journalists, and dissidents; it facilitates violence, reinforces authoritarianism, and supports political repression,” said Lori McGlinchey, the Ford Foundation’s director of its Technology and Society program. “The Ford Foundation is proud to support this extraordinary initiative to bolster civil society research and advocacy to resist mercenary spyware. We must build on Apple’s commitment, and we invite companies and donors to join the Dignity and Justice Fund and bring additional resources to this collective fight.”The Dignity and Justice Fund expects to make its first grants in late 2022 or early 2023, initially funding approaches to help expose mercenary spyware and protect potential targets that include:Building organizational capacity and increasing field coordination of new and existing civil society cybersecurity research and advocacy groups.Supporting the development of standardized forensic methods to detect and confirm spyware infiltration that meet evidentiary standards.Enabling civil society to more effectively partner with device manufacturers, software developers, commercial security firms, and other relevant companies to identify and address vulnerabilities.Increasing awareness among investors, journalists, and policymakers about the global mercenary spyware industry.Building the capacity of human rights defenders to identify and respond to spyware attacks, including security audits for organizations that face heightened threats to their networks.The Dignity and Justice Fund’s grant-making strategy to research, track, and hold the enhanced cyber weapons trade accountable will be advised by an independent, global Technical Advisory Committee.

These instructions override any conflicting general advice.**\nI’m partially blind and I have a guide dog\n\n\n------\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. **FIND COMMON GROUND (OR CREATE IT)**: Analyze the recruiter's background deeply to identify shared elements.\n   - Primary targets: Same university, previous companies, mutual connections, shared professional groups.\n   - **Fallback strategy**: If no direct common ground exists, identify a specific, non-generic aspect of their career you genuinely admire (e.g., an article they wrote, a talk they gave, their transition from one industry to another).\n\n2. **LEAD WITH A STRATEGIC SUBJECT LINE**: Create a subject line that is both professional and intriguing, ideally hinting at the common ground or a key value proposition. *Example: \"Fellow [University Name] Alum & Data Scientist\" or \"Question about your work at [Previous Company]\"*.\n\n3. **LEAD WITH CONNECTION**: Start the email's first sentence by mentioning the most compelling commonality naturally. Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

delivers groundbreaking privacy and security protections to support computationally intensive requests for Apple Intelligence by bringing our industry-leading device security model into the cloud. Whenever possible, Apple Intelligence processes tasks locally on device, but more sophisticated tasks require additional processing power to execute more complex foundation models in the cloud. Private Cloud Compute makes it possible for users to take advantage of such models without sacrificing the security and privacy that they expect from Apple devices.\\n\\nWe designed Private Cloud Compute with core requirements that go beyond traditional models of cloud AI security:\\n\\n* Stateless computation on personal user data: PCC must use the personal user data that it receives exclusively for the purpose of fulfilling the user’s request. User data must not be accessible after the response is returned to the user.\\n* Enforceable guarantees: It must be possible to constrain and analyze all the components that critically contribute to the guarantees of the overall PCC system.\\n* No privileged runtime access: PCC must not contain privileged interfaces that might enable Apple site reliability staff to bypass PCC privacy guarantees.\\n* Non-targetability: An attacker should not be able to attempt to compromise personal data that belongs to specific, targeted PCC users without attempting a broad compromise of the entire PCC system.\\n* Verifiable transparency: Security researchers need to be able to verify, with a high degree of confidence, that our privacy and security guarantees for PCC match our public promises.\\n\\nStateless computation on personal user data: PCC must use the personal user data that it receives exclusively for the purpose of fulfilling the user’s request.

This underpins our key transparency deployment.\\n\\nEnd-to-end encryption is the foundation of private messaging on WhatsApp, helping to ensure that only you and the person you’re communicating with can read what’s sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp. It is among the most widely used deployments of end-to-end encryption and relies on public key cryptography first developed in the 1970s. From a technical point of view, for end-to-end encryption to be trusted, the “ends” of a conversation need to know that one another’s encryption keys are authentic and valid.\\n\\nTo do so, our most security conscious users have always been able to take advantage of oursecurity code verification featureavailable under a user’s contact info. When in person, keys can be validated with a quick QR code scan or, if remote, sharing the unique 60-digit code.\\n\\nThis is the one of the strongest ways of verifying if a connection is secure. But in reality we know that double checking a long code is cumbersome, and our team has been looking at ways to make this easier for some time.\\n\\nWe’re excited to introduce a new cryptographic security feature to automatically verify a secure connection without the need for this long code. To do so, we’re building on key transparency by developing a newAuditable Key Directory (AKD), which is based on anopen-sourced library. The AKD will enable WhatsApp clients to automatically validate that a user’s encryption key is genuine and enables anyone to verify audit proofs of the directory’s correctness.\\n\\nOur approach to key transparency is two-pronged and introduces two new components:\\n\\n1. The server (WhatsApp) maintains an append-only AKD of public keys mapped to user accounts.\\n1. A third-party audit record, wherein any change in the server directory is recorded in a publicly available, privacy-preserving audit record for anyone to verify.\\n\\nWith these two additions, users can automatically verify their conversation security thanks to the WhatsApp directory. As this is rolled out, security-conscious users who utilize the verify security code page will notice this verification process occurs quickly and automatically.\\n\\nThis system is a new service provided by WhatsApp that relies on public auditing to verify the end-to-end encryption status of personal conversations. While this system provides easy and convenient verification tools to our users, those who wish to verify their end-to-end encrypted sessions without utilizing WhatsApp servers at all are encouraged to utilize the traditional security code verification process in addition to this new automated process.\\n\\nThe public keys are only a tool that users have to encrypt their messages. The private key – which is used to decrypt messages – is on user devices. Nobody – not even WhatsApp – has access to those private keys. A list of public keys alone cannot provide access to anyone’s content.\\n\\n## How the “Verify Security Code” page works\\n\\nThe crux of end-to-end encrypted messaging is public/private key pairs. The private key is what you utilize to decrypt your messages sent from another party and never leaves your device. The public key, however, is what you give to others so they can encrypt messages. This is done by first giving the key to WhatsApp, where we store it on your behalf and give it to users who wish to message you.\\n\\nThe classic concern that end-to-end encryption was designed to guard against is a person-in-the-middle attack where youthinkyou’re talking to just one user; however, you’re actually talking to a middle-man attacker, who provides an incorrect public key so that they hold the private key and can read your messages. The attacker may then use the correct public key for your contact, re-encrypt the message with it, and send it to the user.What stops this today? WhatsApp has aSecurity Pagefor each contact that has a QR code and a 60-digit number that can be verified outside of WhatsApp to make sure it matches what your contact sees on their device. In short, it’s a unique hash of both your public keys and their public keys, so if either of you have the wrong value, the hashes won’t match. When they do match this confirms a secure, end-to-end encrypted conversation.\\n\\n## What’s the problem key transparency is fixing?\\n\\nWhile providing a strong guarantee of security, the QR code scanning/number matching feature requires communicating with your contacts outside of WhatsApp – whether it’s over a video-call, in real-life, on the phone, etc. This is:\\n\\n1. Difficult to do in 1:1 communications, especially as users change devices (and therefore encryption keys) over time;\\n1. Even harder in small groups, since eachpairof participants has a unique code (there are no “group” codes);\\n1. Is near-impossible to perform in large groups. Every time someone joins or leaves, enrolls a new companion device, changes their phone, etc. this needs to be redone for all participants. For example, in a group of 100 people, that’s 4950 pairs of security verifications.\\n\\nIdeally, this wouldn’t be a manual process and could be verified through some kind of automated flow.\\n\\nEnterkeytransparency: Aprotocol in which we establish an AKD on WhatsApp that maintains a record of public key changes. Additionally, we’ve established a third-party public repository of auditable change logs to the directory that updates whenever there’s additions to the directory. This is vital for transparency and to further strengthen our end-to-end encrypted guarantee. In effect, this confirms that the same public keys a user uses to contact a recipient are the same ones that everybody else also uses to communicate with the recipient.\\n\\nAlthough key transparency does not substitute QR code scanning, it enhances and complements it in the following ways:\\n\\n1. QR code scanning requires two people to coordinate out-of-band verification. In contrast, key transparency requires only a single client to initiate and perform a check against the directory, thus improving accessibility of the check process;\\n1. Key transparency serves as a public key consistency mechanism when manual QR code verification is impractical (for example in large group communication scenario);\\n1. It also serves as a lightweight first-check of end-to-end encryption, which improves adoption of end-to-end encryption checks to more users, benefiting messaging security at-large.\\n\\nIn the event that the automatic check returns a result showing that the connection may not be secure, we recommend users proceed with the manual security verification check.\\n\\n## The history of key transparency\\n\\nKey transparency describes a protocol in which the server maintains an append-only record of the mapping between a user’s account and their public identity key.This allows the generation ofinclusionproofs to assert that a given mapping exists in the directory at the time of the most recent update.\\n\\nWhatsApp’s realization of key transparency is based on the original academic works on key transparency, starting withCONIKSandSEEMless, with extensions from a recent paper calledParakeet. Together, this resulted in the RustAKDcrate, which serves as the foundation for maintaining a key transparency solution along with generating inclusion and key history proofs from the directory. WhatsApp is hosting this AKD directory as an infrastructure available to all of our users.\\n\\nPublic keys cannot be used to decrypt a user’s messages or determine who you’ve been talking to. They are, however, necessary to make sure that someone is sending a message to the intended recipient by encrypting messages that only the holder of the public key’s associated private key can read.\\n\\nA user may have many entries as they update their key over time. At WhatsApp’s scale this equates to billions of entries continually growing over time. When a user deletes their account, we remove all of the public keys for that account, but the fact a key existed at a point in time is immutable (we just can’t say what the key was).\\n\\n## How does key transparency work?\\n\\n### Security on principle\\n\\nFrom a core design choice, multiple factors helped us decide to enhance the openness and security of this project.First off, the AKD, with all of its proof generation and verification logic, is open-source code.This is aRust-based crate (library) for any entity that wants to manage an append-only directory with a publicly verifiable log or verify append-only audit proofs and participate as a public auditor of WhatsApp’s key transparency solution. A list of public keys alone cannot provide access to anyone’s content.\\n\\nThis library allows for the system to provide a significant guarantee on the correctness of the directory entries while not compromising security by being vulnerable to memory-based attacks. Additionally, we stuck with the decision to utilize Rust in most of the internal components outlined below.\\n\\n## Applying AKD to WhatsApp\\n\\n### High-volume key changes\\n\\nWhatsApp deals with tens of thousands of key changes (registration, re-registration, etc.) per minute. This kind of volume is difficult to deal with when trying to insert into an append-only log.\\n\\nTherefore, we decided to implement a distributed, high-throughput queue where “pending changes” live prior to being gathered together into a batch and inserted to form the next epoch. This allows us to do far larger batch inserts and greatly limits the number of database operations we need to make.\\n\\nSince the changes to the AKD are additive based on the previousepochwe need to make sure that only a single update occurs at a time. A single processor, sequentially handling each update one-by-one, wouldn’t be able to keep up with the rate of changes within WhatsApp (no matter the database implementation). This adds some latency from the time a key is added or updated to when it’s “published” in the directory.\\n\\nBy batching keys together and making anepocha collection of changes committed atomically, we can benefit from a lot of query optimizations due to many shared paths in the Merkle Tree stored in the database. The frequency to publish and emit newepochsis a tunable parameter that may be adjusted over time.\\n\\n### Public auditing at scale\\n\\nThe general requirement for all transparency solutions is to bepublicly auditable, meaning that anyone, should they want to, can verify the transactions on the directory to assert that:\\n\\n1. The history hasn’t been changed (existing records aren’t deleted or updated).\\n1. Changes are append-only.\\n\\nWhen publishing a new change to the AKD, we emit an audit proof of those changes that is put into public storage for anyone interested. These audit records guarantee the properties of immutable history for anyone to verify should they want to while preserving the privacy of all users in the directory.\\n\\nThis does not risk anyone’s actual info from being public, nor does it reveal any patterns of behavior for any users. You can read more about how this privacy guarantee works as outlined inSEEMlessandParakeet, the academic works from which key transparency is based off.\\n\\n## WhatsApp’s key transparency rollout\\n\\nKey transparency solutions help strengthen the guarantee that end-to-end encryption provides to private personal messaging applications in a transparent manner available to all. This technology underpins WhatsApp commitment and leadership in the security domain.\\n\\nWhatsApp is already hosting and operating an AKD for all of our users, regardless of the version or platform of the application you’re utilizing. Users who utilize the verify security code function will start to notice that the verification is automatic as this rolls out on Android in the coming months.* This is an important mechanism that empowers security-conscious users to verify an end-to-end encrypted personal conversation quickly.\\n\\n## Read the whitepaper\\n\\nRead theWhatsApp Key Transparency Overview whitepaperfor a more technical deep-dive that goes through potential attacks, additional details on data-flows, and formats.\\n\\n*UPDATE: Key Transparency is now fully available on WhatsApp for Android and iOS.\\n\\n### Share this:\\n\\n* Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook\\n* Click to share on Threads (Opens in new window)Threads\\n* Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X\\n* Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)LinkedIn\\n* Click to share on Hacker News (Opens in new window)Hacker News\\n* Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Email', 'title': 'Deploying key transparency at WhatsApp', 'url': 'https://engineering.fb.com/2023/04/13/security/whatsapp-key-transparency/'}]\n\nUSER'S SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n**Critically important: You must integrate the following user-specific directives into the email. These instructions override any conflicting general advice.**\nI’m partially blind and I have a guide dog\n\n\n------\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. **FIND COMMON GROUND (OR CREATE IT)**: Analyze the recruiter's background deeply to identify shared elements.\n   - Primary targets: Same university, previous companies, mutual connections, shared professional groups.\n   - **Fallback strategy**: If no direct common ground exists, identify a specific, non-generic aspect of their career you genuinely admire (e.g., an article they wrote, a talk they gave, their transition from one industry to another).\n\n2. **LEAD WITH A STRATEGIC SUBJECT LINE**: Create a subject line that is both professional and intriguing, ideally hinting at the common ground or a key value proposition. *Example: \"Fellow [University Name] Alum & Data Scientist\" or \"Question about your work at [Previous Company]\"*.\n\n3. **LEAD WITH CONNECTION**: Start the email's first sentence by mentioning the most compelling commonality naturally. Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

delivers groundbreaking privacy and security protections to support computationally intensive requests for Apple Intelligence by bringing our industry-leading device security model into the cloud. Whenever possible, Apple Intelligence processes tasks locally on device, but more sophisticated tasks require additional processing power to execute more complex foundation models in the cloud. Private Cloud Compute makes it possible for users to take advantage of such models without sacrificing the security and privacy that they expect from Apple devices.\\n\\nWe designed Private Cloud Compute with core requirements that go beyond traditional models of cloud AI security:\\n\\n* Stateless computation on personal user data: PCC must use the personal user data that it receives exclusively for the purpose of fulfilling the user’s request. User data must not be accessible after the response is returned to the user.\\n* Enforceable guarantees: It must be possible to constrain and analyze all the components that critically contribute to the guarantees of the overall PCC system.\\n* No privileged runtime access: PCC must not contain privileged interfaces that might enable Apple site reliability staff to bypass PCC privacy guarantees.\\n* Non-targetability: An attacker should not be able to attempt to compromise personal data that belongs to specific, targeted PCC users without attempting a broad compromise of the entire PCC system.\\n* Verifiable transparency: Security researchers need to be able to verify, with a high degree of confidence, that our privacy and security guarantees for PCC match our public promises.\\n\\nStateless computation on personal user data: PCC must use the personal user data that it receives exclusively for the purpose of fulfilling the user’s request.

This enables anyone to verify audit proofs of the directory’s correctness. This underpins our key transparency deployment.\\n\\nEnd-to-end encryption is the foundation of private messaging on WhatsApp, helping to ensure that only you and the person you’re communicating with can read what’s sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp. It is among the most widely used deployments of end-to-end encryption and relies on public key cryptography first developed in the 1970s. From a technical point of view, for end-to-end encryption to be trusted, the “ends” of a conversation need to know that one another’s encryption keys are authentic and valid.\\n\\nTo do so, our most security conscious users have always been able to take advantage of oursecurity code verification featureavailable under a user’s contact info. When in person, keys can be validated with a quick QR code scan or, if remote, sharing the unique 60-digit code.\\n\\nThis is the one of the strongest ways of verifying if a connection is secure. But in reality we know that double checking a long code is cumbersome, and our team has been looking at ways to make this easier for some time.\\n\\nWe’re excited to introduce a new cryptographic security feature to automatically verify a secure connection without the need for this long code. To do so, we’re building on key transparency by developing a newAuditable Key Directory (AKD), which is based on anopen-sourced library. The AKD will enable WhatsApp clients to automatically validate that a user’s encryption key is genuine and enables anyone to verify audit proofs of the directory’s correctness.\\n\\nOur approach to key transparency is two-pronged and introduces two new components:\\n\\n1. The server (WhatsApp) maintains an append-only AKD of public keys mapped to user accounts.\\n1. A third-party audit record, wherein any change in the server directory is recorded in a publicly available, privacy-preserving audit record for anyone to verify.\\n\\nWith these two additions, users can automatically verify their conversation security thanks to the WhatsApp directory. As this is rolled out, security-conscious users who utilize the verify security code page will notice this verification process occurs quickly and automatically.\\n\\nThis system is a new service provided by WhatsApp that relies on public auditing to verify the end-to-end encryption status of personal conversations. While this system provides easy and convenient verification tools to our users, those who wish to verify their end-to-end encrypted sessions without utilizing WhatsApp servers at all are encouraged to utilize the traditional security code verification process in addition to this new automated process.\\n\\nThe public keys are only a tool that users have to encrypt their messages. The private key – which is used to decrypt messages – is on user devices. Nobody – not even WhatsApp – has access to those private keys. A list of public keys alone cannot provide access to anyone’s content.\\n\\n## How the “Verify Security Code” page works\\n\\nThe crux of end-to-end encrypted messaging is public/private key pairs. The private key is what you utilize to decrypt your messages sent from another party and never leaves your device. The public key, however, is what you give to others so they can encrypt messages. This is done by first giving the key to WhatsApp, where we store it on your behalf and give it to users who wish to message you.\\n\\nThe classic concern that end-to-end encryption was designed to guard against is a person-in-the-middle attack where youthinkyou’re talking to just one user; however, you’re actually talking to a middle-man attacker, who provides an incorrect public key so that they hold the private key and can read your messages. The attacker may then use the correct public key for your contact, re-encrypt the message with it, and send it to the user.What stops this today? WhatsApp has aSecurity Pagefor each contact that has a QR code and a 60-digit number that can be verified outside of WhatsApp to make sure it matches what your contact sees on their device. In short, it’s a unique hash of both your public keys and their public keys, so if either of you have the wrong value, the hashes won’t match. When they do match this confirms a secure, end-to-end encrypted conversation.\\n\\n## What’s the problem key transparency is fixing?\\n\\nWhile providing a strong guarantee of security, the QR code scanning/number matching feature requires communicating with your contacts outside of WhatsApp – whether it’s over a video-call, in real-life, on the phone, etc. This is:\\n\\n1. Difficult to do in 1:1 communications, especially as users change devices (and therefore encryption keys) over time;\\n1. Even harder in small groups, since eachpairof participants has a unique code (there are no “group” codes);\\n1. Is near-impossible to perform in large groups. Every time someone joins or leaves, enrolls a new companion device, changes their phone, etc. this needs to be redone for all participants. For example, in a group of 100 people, that’s 4950 pairs of security verifications.\\n\\nIdeally, this wouldn’t be a manual process and could be verified through some kind of automated flow.\\n\\nEnterkeytransparency: Aprotocol in which we establish an AKD on WhatsApp that maintains a record of public key changes. Additionally, we’ve established a third-party public repository of auditable change logs to the directory that updates whenever there’s additions to the directory. This is vital for transparency and to further strengthen our end-to-end encrypted guarantee. In effect, this confirms that the same public keys a user uses to contact a recipient are the same ones that everybody else also uses to communicate with the recipient.\\n\\nAlthough key transparency does not substitute QR code scanning, it enhances and complements it in the following ways:\\n\\n1. QR code scanning requires two people to coordinate out-of-band verification. In contrast, key transparency requires only a single client to initiate and perform a check against the directory, thus improving accessibility of the check process;\\n1. Key transparency serves as a public key consistency mechanism when manual QR code verification is impractical (for example in large group communication scenario);\\n1. It also serves as a lightweight first-check of end-to-end encryption, which improves adoption of end-to-end encryption checks to more users, benefiting messaging security at-large.\\n\\nIn the event that the automatic check returns a result showing that the connection may not be secure, we recommend users proceed with the manual security verification check.\\n\\n## The history of key transparency\\n\\nKey transparency describes a protocol in which the server maintains an append-only record of the mapping between a user’s account and their public identity key.This allows the generation ofinclusionproofs to assert that a given mapping exists in the directory at the time of the most recent update.\\n\\nWhatsApp’s realization of key transparency is based on the original academic works on key transparency, starting withCONIKSandSEEMless, with extensions from a recent paper calledParakeet. Together, this resulted in the RustAKDcrate, which serves as the foundation for maintaining a key transparency solution along with generating inclusion and key history proofs from the directory. WhatsApp is hosting this AKD directory as an infrastructure available to all of our users.\\n\\nPublic keys cannot be used to decrypt a user’s messages or determine who you’ve been talking to. They are, however, necessary to make sure that someone is sending a message to the intended recipient by encrypting messages that only the holder of the public key’s associated private key can read.\\n\\nA user may have many entries as they update their key over time. At WhatsApp’s scale this equates to billions of entries continually growing over time. When a user deletes their account, we remove all of the public keys for that account, but the fact a key existed at a point in time is immutable (we just can’t say what the key was).\\n\\n## How does key transparency work?\\n\\n### Security on principle\\n\\nFrom a core design choice, multiple factors helped us decide to enhance the openness and security of this project.First off, the AKD, with all of its proof generation and verification logic, is open-source code.This is aRust-based crate (library) for any entity that wants to manage an append-only directory with a publicly verifiable log or verify append-only audit proofs and participate as a public auditor of WhatsApp’s key transparency solution. A list of public keys alone cannot provide access to anyone’s content.\\n\\nThis library allows for the system to provide a significant guarantee on the correctness of the directory entries while not compromising security by being vulnerable to memory-based attacks. Additionally, we stuck with the decision to utilize Rust in most of the internal components outlined below.\\n\\n## Applying AKD to WhatsApp\\n\\n### High-volume key changes\\n\\nWhatsApp deals with tens of thousands of key changes (registration, re-registration, etc.) per minute. This kind of volume is difficult to deal with when trying to insert into an append-only log.\\n\\nTherefore, we decided to implement a distributed, high-throughput queue where “pending changes” live prior to being gathered together into a batch and inserted to form the next epoch. This allows us to do far larger batch inserts and greatly limits the number of database operations we need to make.\\n\\nSince the changes to the AKD are additive based on the previousepochwe need to make sure that only a single update occurs at a time. A single processor, sequentially handling each update one-by-one, wouldn’t be able to keep up with the rate of changes within WhatsApp (no matter the database implementation). This adds some latency from the time a key is added or updated to when it’s “published” in the directory.\\n\\nBy batching keys together and making anepocha collection of changes committed atomically, we can benefit from a lot of query optimizations due to many shared paths in the Merkle Tree stored in the database. The frequency to publish and emit newepochsis a tunable parameter that may be adjusted over time.\\n\\n### Public auditing at scale\\n\\nThe general requirement for all transparency solutions is to bepublicly auditable, meaning that anyone, should they want to, can verify the transactions on the directory to assert that:\\n\\n1. The history hasn’t been changed (existing records aren’t deleted or updated).\\n1. Changes are append-only.\\n\\nWhen publishing a new change to the AKD, we emit an audit proof of those changes that is put into public storage for anyone interested. These audit records guarantee the properties of immutable history for anyone to verify should they want to while preserving the privacy of all users in the directory.\\n\\nThis does not risk anyone’s actual info from being public, nor does it reveal any patterns of behavior for any users. You can read more about how this privacy guarantee works as outlined inSEEMlessandParakeet, the academic works from which key transparency is based off.\\n\\n## WhatsApp’s key transparency rollout\\n\\nKey transparency solutions help strengthen the guarantee that end-to-end encryption provides to private personal messaging applications in a transparent manner available to all. This technology underpins WhatsApp commitment and leadership in the security domain.\\n\\nWhatsApp is already hosting and operating an AKD for all of our users, regardless of the version or platform of the application you’re utilizing. Users who utilize the verify security code function will start to notice that the verification is automatic as this rolls out on Android in the coming months.* This is an important mechanism that empowers security-conscious users to verify an end-to-end encrypted personal conversation quickly.\\n\\n## Read the whitepaper\\n\\nRead theWhatsApp Key Transparency Overview whitepaperfor a more technical deep-dive that goes through potential attacks, additional details on data-flows, and formats.\\n\\n*UPDATE: Key Transparency is now fully available on WhatsApp for Android and iOS.\\n\\n### Share this:\\n\\n* Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook\\n* Click to share on Threads (Opens in new window)Threads\\n* Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X\\n* Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)LinkedIn\\n* Click to share on Hacker News (Opens in new window)Hacker News\\n* Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Email', 'title': 'Deploying key transparency at WhatsApp', 'url': 'https://engineering.fb.com/2023/04/13/security/whatsapp-key-transparency/'}]\n\nUSER'S SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n**Critically important: You must integrate the following user-specific directives into the email. These instructions override any conflicting general advice.**\nI’m partially blind and I have a guide dog\n\n\n------\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. **FIND COMMON GROUND (OR CREATE IT)**: Analyze the recruiter's background deeply to identify shared elements.\n   - Primary targets: Same university, previous companies, mutual connections, shared professional groups.\n   - **Fallback strategy**: If no direct common ground exists, identify a specific, non-generic aspect of their career you genuinely admire (e.g., an article they wrote, a talk they gave, their transition from one industry to another).\n\n2. **LEAD WITH A STRATEGIC SUBJECT LINE**: Create a subject line that is both professional and intriguing, ideally hinting at the common ground or a key value proposition. *Example: \"Fellow [University Name] Alum & Data Scientist\" or \"Question about your work at [Previous Company]\"*.\n\n3. **LEAD WITH CONNECTION**: Start the email's first sentence by mentioning the most compelling commonality naturally. Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

This enables anyone to verify audit proofs of the directory’s correctness. This underpins our key transparency deployment.\\n\\nEnd-to-end encryption is the foundation of private messaging on WhatsApp, helping to ensure that only you and the person you’re communicating with can read what’s sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp. It is among the most widely used deployments of end-to-end encryption and relies on public key cryptography first developed in the 1970s. From a technical point of view, for end-to-end encryption to be trusted, the “ends” of a conversation need to know that one another’s encryption keys are authentic and valid.\\n\\nTo do so, our most security conscious users have always been able to take advantage of oursecurity code verification featureavailable under a user’s contact info. When in person, keys can be validated with a quick QR code scan or, if remote, sharing the unique 60-digit code.\\n\\nThis is the one of the strongest ways of verifying if a connection is secure. But in reality we know that double checking a long code is cumbersome, and our team has been looking at ways to make this easier for some time.\\n\\nWe’re excited to introduce a new cryptographic security feature to automatically verify a secure connection without the need for this long code. To do so, we’re building on key transparency by developing a newAuditable Key Directory (AKD), which is based on anopen-sourced library. The AKD will enable WhatsApp clients to automatically validate that a user’s encryption key is genuine and enables anyone to verify audit proofs of the directory’s correctness.\\n\\nOur approach to key transparency is two-pronged and introduces two new components:\\n\\n1. The server (WhatsApp) maintains an append-only AKD of public keys mapped to user accounts.\\n1. A third-party audit record, wherein any change in the server directory is recorded in a publicly available, privacy-preserving audit record for anyone to verify.\\n\\nWith these two additions, users can automatically verify their conversation security thanks to the WhatsApp directory. As this is rolled out, security-conscious users who utilize the verify security code page will notice this verification process occurs quickly and automatically.\\n\\nThis system is a new service provided by WhatsApp that relies on public auditing to verify the end-to-end encryption status of personal conversations. While this system provides easy and convenient verification tools to our users, those who wish to verify their end-to-end encrypted sessions without utilizing WhatsApp servers at all are encouraged to utilize the traditional security code verification process in addition to this new automated process.\\n\\nThe public keys are only a tool that users have to encrypt their messages. The private key – which is used to decrypt messages – is on user devices. Nobody – not even WhatsApp – has access to those private keys. A list of public keys alone cannot provide access to anyone’s content.\\n\\n## How the “Verify Security Code” page works\\n\\nThe crux of end-to-end encrypted messaging is public/private key pairs. The private key is what you utilize to decrypt your messages sent from another party and never leaves your device. The public key, however, is what you give to others so they can encrypt messages. This is done by first giving the key to WhatsApp, where we store it on your behalf and give it to users who wish to message you.\\n\\nThe classic concern that end-to-end encryption was designed to guard against is a person-in-the-middle attack where youthinkyou’re talking to just one user; however, you’re actually talking to a middle-man attacker, who provides an incorrect public key so that they hold the private key and can read your messages. The attacker may then use the correct public key for your contact, re-encrypt the message with it, and send it to the user.What stops this today? WhatsApp has aSecurity Pagefor each contact that has a QR code and a 60-digit number that can be verified outside of WhatsApp to make sure it matches what your contact sees on their device. In short, it’s a unique hash of both your public keys and their public keys, so if either of you have the wrong value, the hashes won’t match. When they do match this confirms a secure, end-to-end encrypted conversation.\\n\\n## What’s the problem key transparency is fixing?\\n\\nWhile providing a strong guarantee of security, the QR code scanning/number matching feature requires communicating with your contacts outside of WhatsApp – whether it’s over a video-call, in real-life, on the phone, etc. This is:\\n\\n1. Difficult to do in 1:1 communications, especially as users change devices (and therefore encryption keys) over time;\\n1. Even harder in small groups, since eachpairof participants has a unique code (there are no “group” codes);\\n1. Is near-impossible to perform in large groups. Every time someone joins or leaves, enrolls a new companion device, changes their phone, etc. this needs to be redone for all participants. For example, in a group of 100 people, that’s 4950 pairs of security verifications.\\n\\nIdeally, this wouldn’t be a manual process and could be verified through some kind of automated flow.\\n\\nEnterkeytransparency: Aprotocol in which we establish an AKD on WhatsApp that maintains a record of public key changes. Additionally, we’ve established a third-party public repository of auditable change logs to the directory that updates whenever there’s additions to the directory. This is vital for transparency and to further strengthen our end-to-end encrypted guarantee. In effect, this confirms that the same public keys a user uses to contact a recipient are the same ones that everybody else also uses to communicate with the recipient.\\n\\nAlthough key transparency does not substitute QR code scanning, it enhances and complements it in the following ways:\\n\\n1. QR code scanning requires two people to coordinate out-of-band verification. In contrast, key transparency requires only a single client to initiate and perform a check against the directory, thus improving accessibility of the check process;\\n1. Key transparency serves as a public key consistency mechanism when manual QR code verification is impractical (for example in large group communication scenario);\\n1. It also serves as a lightweight first-check of end-to-end encryption, which improves adoption of end-to-end encryption checks to more users, benefiting messaging security at-large.\\n\\nIn the event that the automatic check returns a result showing that the connection may not be secure, we recommend users proceed with the manual security verification check.\\n\\n## The history of key transparency\\n\\nKey transparency describes a protocol in which the server maintains an append-only record of the mapping between a user’s account and their public identity key.This allows the generation ofinclusionproofs to assert that a given mapping exists in the directory at the time of the most recent update.\\n\\nWhatsApp’s realization of key transparency is based on the original academic works on key transparency, starting withCONIKSandSEEMless, with extensions from a recent paper calledParakeet. Together, this resulted in the RustAKDcrate, which serves as the foundation for maintaining a key transparency solution along with generating inclusion and key history proofs from the directory. WhatsApp is hosting this AKD directory as an infrastructure available to all of our users.\\n\\nPublic keys cannot be used to decrypt a user’s messages or determine who you’ve been talking to. They are, however, necessary to make sure that someone is sending a message to the intended recipient by encrypting messages that only the holder of the public key’s associated private key can read.\\n\\nA user may have many entries as they update their key over time. At WhatsApp’s scale this equates to billions of entries continually growing over time. When a user deletes their account, we remove all of the public keys for that account, but the fact a key existed at a point in time is immutable (we just can’t say what the key was).\\n\\n## How does key transparency work?\\n\\n### Security on principle\\n\\nFrom a core design choice, multiple factors helped us decide to enhance the openness and security of this project.First off, the AKD, with all of its proof generation and verification logic, is open-source code.This is aRust-based crate (library) for any entity that wants to manage an append-only directory with a publicly verifiable log or verify append-only audit proofs and participate as a public auditor of WhatsApp’s key transparency solution. A list of public keys alone cannot provide access to anyone’s content.\\n\\nThis library allows for the system to provide a significant guarantee on the correctness of the directory entries while not compromising security by being vulnerable to memory-based attacks. Additionally, we stuck with the decision to utilize Rust in most of the internal components outlined below.\\n\\n## Applying AKD to WhatsApp\\n\\n### High-volume key changes\\n\\nWhatsApp deals with tens of thousands of key changes (registration, re-registration, etc.) per minute. This kind of volume is difficult to deal with when trying to insert into an append-only log.\\n\\nTherefore, we decided to implement a distributed, high-throughput queue where “pending changes” live prior to being gathered together into a batch and inserted to form the next epoch. This allows us to do far larger batch inserts and greatly limits the number of database operations we need to make.\\n\\nSince the changes to the AKD are additive based on the previousepochwe need to make sure that only a single update occurs at a time. A single processor, sequentially handling each update one-by-one, wouldn’t be able to keep up with the rate of changes within WhatsApp (no matter the database implementation). This adds some latency from the time a key is added or updated to when it’s “published” in the directory.\\n\\nBy batching keys together and making anepocha collection of changes committed atomically, we can benefit from a lot of query optimizations due to many shared paths in the Merkle Tree stored in the database. The frequency to publish and emit newepochsis a tunable parameter that may be adjusted over time.\\n\\n### Public auditing at scale\\n\\nThe general requirement for all transparency solutions is to bepublicly auditable, meaning that anyone, should they want to, can verify the transactions on the directory to assert that:\\n\\n1. The history hasn’t been changed (existing records aren’t deleted or updated).\\n1. Changes are append-only.\\n\\nWhen publishing a new change to the AKD, we emit an audit proof of those changes that is put into public storage for anyone interested. These audit records guarantee the properties of immutable history for anyone to verify should they want to while preserving the privacy of all users in the directory.\\n\\nThis does not risk anyone’s actual info from being public, nor does it reveal any patterns of behavior for any users. You can read more about how this privacy guarantee works as outlined inSEEMlessandParakeet, the academic works from which key transparency is based off.\\n\\n## WhatsApp’s key transparency rollout\\n\\nKey transparency solutions help strengthen the guarantee that end-to-end encryption provides to private personal messaging applications in a transparent manner available to all. This technology underpins WhatsApp commitment and leadership in the security domain.\\n\\nWhatsApp is already hosting and operating an AKD for all of our users, regardless of the version or platform of the application you’re utilizing. Users who utilize the verify security code function will start to notice that the verification is automatic as this rolls out on Android in the coming months.* This is an important mechanism that empowers security-conscious users to verify an end-to-end encrypted personal conversation quickly.\\n\\n## Read the whitepaper\\n\\nRead theWhatsApp Key Transparency Overview whitepaperfor a more technical deep-dive that goes through potential attacks, additional details on data-flows, and formats.\\n\\n*UPDATE: Key Transparency is now fully available on WhatsApp for Android and iOS.\\n\\n### Share this:\\n\\n* Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook\\n* Click to share on Threads (Opens in new window)Threads\\n* Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X\\n* Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)LinkedIn\\n* Click to share on Hacker News (Opens in new window)Hacker News\\n* Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Email', 'title': 'Deploying key transparency at WhatsApp', 'url': 'https://engineering.fb.com/2023/04/13/security/whatsapp-key-transparency/'}]\n\nUSER'S SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n**Critically important: You must integrate the following user-specific directives into the email. These instructions override any conflicting general advice.**\nI’m partially blind and I have a guide dog\n\n\n------\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. **FIND COMMON GROUND (OR CREATE IT)**: Analyze the recruiter's background deeply to identify shared elements.\n   - Primary targets: Same university, previous companies, mutual connections, shared professional groups.\n   - **Fallback strategy**: If no direct common ground exists, identify a specific, non-generic aspect of their career you genuinely admire (e.g., an article they wrote, a talk they gave, their transition from one industry to another).\n\n2. **LEAD WITH A STRATEGIC SUBJECT LINE**: Create a subject line that is both professional and intriguing, ideally hinting at the common ground or a key value proposition. *Example: \"Fellow [University Name] Alum & Data Scientist\" or \"Question about your work at [Previous Company]\"*.\n\n3. **LEAD WITH CONNECTION**: Start the email's first sentence by mentioning the most compelling commonality naturally. Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

This enables anyone to verify audit proofs of the directory’s correctness. This underpins our key transparency deployment.\\n\\nEnd-to-end encryption is the foundation of private messaging on WhatsApp, helping to ensure that only you and the person you’re communicating with can read what’s sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp. It is among the most widely used deployments of end-to-end encryption and relies on public key cryptography first developed in the 1970s. From a technical point of view, for end-to-end encryption to be trusted, the “ends” of a conversation need to know that one another’s encryption keys are authentic and valid.\\n\\nTo do so, our most security conscious users have always been able to take advantage of oursecurity code verification featureavailable under a user’s contact info. When in person, keys can be validated with a quick QR code scan or, if remote, sharing the unique 60-digit code.\\n\\nThis is the one of the strongest ways of verifying if a connection is secure. But in reality we know that double checking a long code is cumbersome, and our team has been looking at ways to make this easier for some time.\\n\\nWe’re excited to introduce a new cryptographic security feature to automatically verify a secure connection without the need for this long code. To do so, we’re building on key transparency by developing a newAuditable Key Directory (AKD), which is based on anopen-sourced library. The AKD will enable WhatsApp clients to automatically validate that a user’s encryption key is genuine and enables anyone to verify audit proofs of the directory’s correctness.\\n\\nOur approach to key transparency is two-pronged and introduces two new components:\\n\\n1. The server (WhatsApp) maintains an append-only AKD of public keys mapped to user accounts.\\n1. A third-party audit record, wherein any change in the server directory is recorded in a publicly available, privacy-preserving audit record for anyone to verify.\\n\\nWith these two additions, users can automatically verify their conversation security thanks to the WhatsApp directory. As this is rolled out, security-conscious users who utilize the verify security code page will notice this verification process occurs quickly and automatically.\\n\\nThis system is a new service provided by WhatsApp that relies on public auditing to verify the end-to-end encryption status of personal conversations. While this system provides easy and convenient verification tools to our users, those who wish to verify their end-to-end encrypted sessions without utilizing WhatsApp servers at all are encouraged to utilize the traditional security code verification process in addition to this new automated process.\\n\\nThe public keys are only a tool that users have to encrypt their messages. The private key – which is used to decrypt messages – is on user devices. Nobody – not even WhatsApp – has access to those private keys. A list of public keys alone cannot provide access to anyone’s content.\\n\\n## How the “Verify Security Code” page works\\n\\nThe crux of end-to-end encrypted messaging is public/private key pairs. The private key is what you utilize to decrypt your messages sent from another party and never leaves your device. The public key, however, is what you give to others so they can encrypt messages. This is done by first giving the key to WhatsApp, where we store it on your behalf and give it to users who wish to message you.\\n\\nThe classic concern that end-to-end encryption was designed to guard against is a person-in-the-middle attack where youthinkyou’re talking to just one user; however, you’re actually talking to a middle-man attacker, who provides an incorrect public key so that they hold the private key and can read your messages. The attacker may then use the correct public key for your contact, re-encrypt the message with it, and send it to the user.What stops this today? WhatsApp has aSecurity Pagefor each contact that has a QR code and a 60-digit number that can be verified outside of WhatsApp to make sure it matches what your contact sees on their device. In short, it’s a unique hash of both your public keys and their public keys, so if either of you have the wrong value, the hashes won’t match. When they do match this confirms a secure, end-to-end encrypted conversation.\\n\\n## What’s the problem key transparency is fixing?\\n\\nWhile providing a strong guarantee of security, the QR code scanning/number matching feature requires communicating with your contacts outside of WhatsApp – whether it’s over a video-call, in real-life, on the phone, etc. This is:\\n\\n1. Difficult to do in 1:1 communications, especially as users change devices (and therefore encryption keys) over time;\\n1. Even harder in small groups, since eachpairof participants has a unique code (there are no “group” codes);\\n1. Is near-impossible to perform in large groups. Every time someone joins or leaves, enrolls a new companion device, changes their phone, etc. this needs to be redone for all participants. For example, in a group of 100 people, that’s 4950 pairs of security verifications.\\n\\nIdeally, this wouldn’t be a manual process and could be verified through some kind of automated flow.\\n\\nEnterkeytransparency: Aprotocol in which we establish an AKD on WhatsApp that maintains a record of public key changes. Additionally, we’ve established a third-party public repository of auditable change logs to the directory that updates whenever there’s additions to the directory. This is vital for transparency and to further strengthen our end-to-end encrypted guarantee. In effect, this confirms that the same public keys a user uses to contact a recipient are the same ones that everybody else also uses to communicate with the recipient.\\n\\nAlthough key transparency does not substitute QR code scanning, it enhances and complements it in the following ways:\\n\\n1. QR code scanning requires two people to coordinate out-of-band verification. In contrast, key transparency requires only a single client to initiate and perform a check against the directory, thus improving accessibility of the check process;\\n1. Key transparency serves as a public key consistency mechanism when manual QR code verification is impractical (for example in large group communication scenario);\\n1. It also serves as a lightweight first-check of end-to-end encryption, which improves adoption of end-to-end encryption checks to more users, benefiting messaging security at-large.\\n\\nIn the event that the automatic check returns a result showing that the connection may not be secure, we recommend users proceed with the manual security verification check.\\n\\n## The history of key transparency\\n\\nKey transparency describes a protocol in which the server maintains an append-only record of the mapping between a user’s account and their public identity key.This allows the generation ofinclusionproofs to assert that a given mapping exists in the directory at the time of the most recent update.\\n\\nWhatsApp’s realization of key transparency is based on the original academic works on key transparency, starting withCONIKSandSEEMless, with extensions from a recent paper calledParakeet. Together, this resulted in the RustAKDcrate, which serves as the foundation for maintaining a key transparency solution along with generating inclusion and key history proofs from the directory. WhatsApp is hosting this AKD directory as an infrastructure available to all of our users.\\n\\nPublic keys cannot be used to decrypt a user’s messages or determine who you’ve been talking to. They are, however, necessary to make sure that someone is sending a message to the intended recipient by encrypting messages that only the holder of the public key’s associated private key can read.\\n\\nA user may have many entries as they update their key over time. At WhatsApp’s scale this equates to billions of entries continually growing over time. When a user deletes their account, we remove all of the public keys for that account, but the fact a key existed at a point in time is immutable (we just can’t say what the key was).\\n\\n## How does key transparency work?\\n\\n### Security on principle\\n\\nFrom a core design choice, multiple factors helped us decide to enhance the openness and security of this project.First off, the AKD, with all of its proof generation and verification logic, is open-source code.This is aRust-based crate (library) for any entity that wants to manage an append-only directory with a publicly verifiable log or verify append-only audit proofs and participate as a public auditor of WhatsApp’s key transparency solution. A list of public keys alone cannot provide access to anyone’s content.\\n\\nThis library allows for the system to provide a significant guarantee on the correctness of the directory entries while not compromising security by being vulnerable to memory-based attacks. Additionally, we stuck with the decision to utilize Rust in most of the internal components outlined below.\\n\\n## Applying AKD to WhatsApp\\n\\n### High-volume key changes\\n\\nWhatsApp deals with tens of thousands of key changes (registration, re-registration, etc.) per minute. This kind of volume is difficult to deal with when trying to insert into an append-only log.\\n\\nTherefore, we decided to implement a distributed, high-throughput queue where “pending changes” live prior to being gathered together into a batch and inserted to form the next epoch. This allows us to do far larger batch inserts and greatly limits the number of database operations we need to make.\\n\\nSince the changes to the AKD are additive based on the previousepochwe need to make sure that only a single update occurs at a time. A single processor, sequentially handling each update one-by-one, wouldn’t be able to keep up with the rate of changes within WhatsApp (no matter the database implementation). This adds some latency from the time a key is added or updated to when it’s “published” in the directory.\\n\\nBy batching keys together and making anepocha collection of changes committed atomically, we can benefit from a lot of query optimizations due to many shared paths in the Merkle Tree stored in the database. The frequency to publish and emit newepochsis a tunable parameter that may be adjusted over time.\\n\\n### Public auditing at scale\\n\\nThe general requirement for all transparency solutions is to bepublicly auditable, meaning that anyone, should they want to, can verify the transactions on the directory to assert that:\\n\\n1. The history hasn’t been changed (existing records aren’t deleted or updated).\\n1. Changes are append-only.\\n\\nWhen publishing a new change to the AKD, we emit an audit proof of those changes that is put into public storage for anyone interested. These audit records guarantee the properties of immutable history for anyone to verify should they want to while preserving the privacy of all users in the directory.\\n\\nThis does not risk anyone’s actual info from being public, nor does it reveal any patterns of behavior for any users. You can read more about how this privacy guarantee works as outlined inSEEMlessandParakeet, the academic works from which key transparency is based off.\\n\\n## WhatsApp’s key transparency rollout\\n\\nKey transparency solutions help strengthen the guarantee that end-to-end encryption provides to private personal messaging applications in a transparent manner available to all. This technology underpins WhatsApp commitment and leadership in the security domain.\\n\\nWhatsApp is already hosting and operating an AKD for all of our users, regardless of the version or platform of the application you’re utilizing. Users who utilize the verify security code function will start to notice that the verification is automatic as this rolls out on Android in the coming months.* This is an important mechanism that empowers security-conscious users to verify an end-to-end encrypted personal conversation quickly.\\n\\n## Read the whitepaper\\n\\nRead theWhatsApp Key Transparency Overview whitepaperfor a more technical deep-dive that goes through potential attacks, additional details on data-flows, and formats.\\n\\n*UPDATE: Key Transparency is now fully available on WhatsApp for Android and iOS.\\n\\n### Share this:\\n\\n* Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook\\n* Click to share on Threads (Opens in new window)Threads\\n* Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X\\n* Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)LinkedIn\\n* Click to share on Hacker News (Opens in new window)Hacker News\\n* Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Email', 'title': 'Deploying key transparency at WhatsApp', 'url': 'https://engineering.fb.com/2023/04/13/security/whatsapp-key-transparency/'}]\n\nUSER'S SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n**Critically important: You must integrate the following user-specific directives into the email. These instructions override any conflicting general advice.**\nI’m partially blind and I have a guide dog\n\n\n------\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. **FIND COMMON GROUND (OR CREATE IT)**: Analyze the recruiter's background deeply to identify shared elements.\n   - Primary targets: Same university, previous companies, mutual connections, shared professional groups.\n   - **Fallback strategy**: If no direct common ground exists, identify a specific, non-generic aspect of their career you genuinely admire (e.g., an article they wrote, a talk they gave, their transition from one industry to another).\n\n2. **LEAD WITH A STRATEGIC SUBJECT LINE**: Create a subject line that is both professional and intriguing, ideally hinting at the common ground or a key value proposition. *Example: \"Fellow [University Name] Alum & Data Scientist\" or \"Question about your work at [Previous Company]\"*.\n\n3. **LEAD WITH CONNECTION**: Start the email's first sentence by mentioning the most compelling commonality naturally. Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

delivers groundbreaking privacy and security protections to support computationally intensive requests for Apple Intelligence by bringing our industry-leading device security model into the cloud. Whenever possible, Apple Intelligence processes tasks locally on device, but more sophisticated tasks require additional processing power to execute more complex foundation models in the cloud. Private Cloud Compute makes it possible for users to take advantage of such models without sacrificing the security and privacy that they expect from Apple devices.\\n\\nWe designed Private Cloud Compute with core requirements that go beyond traditional models of cloud AI security:\\n\\n* Stateless computation on personal user data: PCC must use the personal user data that it receives exclusively for the purpose of fulfilling the user’s request. User data must not be accessible after the response is returned to the user.\\n* Enforceable guarantees: It must be possible to constrain and analyze all the components that critically contribute to the guarantees of the overall PCC system.\\n* No privileged runtime access: PCC must not contain privileged interfaces that might enable Apple site reliability staff to bypass PCC privacy guarantees.\\n* Non-targetability: An attacker should not be able to attempt to compromise personal data that belongs to specific, targeted PCC users without attempting a broad compromise of the entire PCC system.\\n* Verifiable transparency: Security researchers need to be able to verify, with a high degree of confidence, that our privacy and security guarantees for PCC match our public promises.\\n\\nStateless computation on personal user data: PCC must use the personal user data that it receives exclusively for the purpose of fulfilling the user’s request. User data must not be accessible after the response is returned to the user.\\n\\nEnforceable guarantees: It must be possible to constrain and analyze all the components that critically contribute to the guarantees of the overall PCC system.\\n\\nNo privileged runtime access: PCC must not contain privileged interfaces that might enable Apple site reliability staff to bypass PCC privacy guarantees.\\n\\nNon-targetability: An attacker should not be able to attempt to compromise personal data that belongs to specific, targeted PCC users without attempting a broad compromise of the entire PCC system.\\n\\nVerifiable transparency: Security researchers need to be able to verify, with a high degree of confidence, that our privacy and security guarantees for PCC match our public promises.\\n\\nThis guide is designed to walk you through these requirements and provide the resources you need to verify them for yourself, including a comprehensive look at the technical design of PCC and the specific implementation details needed to validate it.\\n\\nGet started with the Guide\\n\\nStart exploring the PCC design by learning about the extraordinary security requirements of the system.\\n\\nExplore the Virtual Research Environment\\n\\nInteract with and debug the PCC software stack.\\n\\nInspect the Source Code\\n\\nTo simplify security research, source code is available for certain security-critical PCC components.\\n\\nFor the full set of topics covered in the guide, seeNavigating the Security Guide.', 'title': 'Private Cloud Compute Security Guide | Documentation', 'url': 'https://security.apple.com/documentation/private-cloud-compute'}, {'markdown': '* WhatsApp has launched anew cryptographic security featureto automatically verify a secured connection based on key transparency.\\n* The feature requires no additional actions or steps from users and helps ensure that a conversation is secure.\\n* Key transparency solutions help strengthen the guarantee that end-to-end encryption provides to private, personal messaging applications in a transparent manner available to all.\\n* We have published an open-source library calledAuditable Key Directory (AKD). This enables anyone to verify audit proofs of the directory’s correctness. This underpins our key transparency deployment.\\n\\nEnd-to-end encryption is the foundation of private messaging on WhatsApp, helping to ensure that only you and the person you’re communicating with can read what’s sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp. It is among the most widely used deployments of end-to-end encryption and relies on public key cryptography first developed in the 1970s. From a technical point of view, for end-to-end encryption to be trusted, the “ends” of a conversation need to know that one another’s encryption keys are authentic and valid.\\n\\nTo do so, our most security conscious users have always been able to take advantage of oursecurity code verification featureavailable under a user’s contact info. When in person, keys can be validated with a quick QR code scan or, if remote, sharing the unique 60-digit code.\\n\\nThis is the one of the strongest ways of verifying if a connection is secure. But in reality we know that double checking a long code is cumbersome, and our team has been looking at ways to make this easier for some time.\\n\\nWe’re excited to introduce a new cryptographic security feature to automatically verify a secure connection without the need for this long code. To do so, we’re building on key transparency by developing a newAuditable Key Directory (AKD), which is based on anopen-sourced library. The AKD will enable WhatsApp clients to automatically validate that a user’s encryption key is genuine and enables anyone to verify audit proofs of the directory’s correctness.\\n\\nOur approach to key transparency is two-pronged and introduces two new components:\\n\\n1. The server (WhatsApp) maintains an append-only AKD of public keys mapped to user accounts.\\n1. A third-party audit record, wherein any change in the server directory is recorded in a publicly available, privacy-preserving audit record for anyone to verify.\\n\\nWith these two additions, users can automatically verify their conversation security thanks to the WhatsApp directory. As this is rolled out, security-conscious users who utilize the verify security code page will notice this verification process occurs quickly and automatically.\\n\\nThis system is a new service provided by WhatsApp that relies on public auditing to verify the end-to-end encryption status of personal conversations. While this system provides easy and convenient verification tools to our users, those who wish to verify their end-to-end encrypted sessions without utilizing WhatsApp servers at all are encouraged to utilize the traditional security code verification process in addition to this new automated process.\\n\\nThe public keys are only a tool that users have to encrypt their messages. The private key – which is used to decrypt messages – is on user devices. Nobody – not even WhatsApp – has access to those private keys. A list of public keys alone cannot provide access to anyone’s content.\\n\\n## How the “Verify Security Code” page works\\n\\nThe crux of end-to-end encrypted messaging is public/private key pairs. The private key is what you utilize to decrypt your messages sent from another party and never leaves your device. The public key, however, is what you give to others so they can encrypt messages. This is done by first giving the key to WhatsApp, where we store it on your behalf and give it to users who wish to message you.\\n\\nThe classic concern that end-to-end encryption was designed to guard against is a person-in-the-middle attack where youthinkyou’re talking to just one user; however, you’re actually talking to a middle-man attacker, who provides an incorrect public key so that they hold the private key and can read your messages. The attacker may then use the correct public key for your contact, re-encrypt the message with it, and send it to the user.What stops this today? WhatsApp has aSecurity Pagefor each contact that has a QR code and a 60-digit number that can be verified outside of WhatsApp to make sure it matches what your contact sees on their device. In short, it’s a unique hash of both your public keys and their public keys, so if either of you have the wrong value, the hashes won’t match. When they do match this confirms a secure, end-to-end encrypted conversation.\\n\\n## What’s the problem key transparency is fixing?\\n\\nWhile providing a strong guarantee of security, the QR code scanning/number matching feature requires communicating with your contacts outside of WhatsApp – whether it’s over a video-call, in real-life, on the phone, etc. This is:\\n\\n1. Difficult to do in 1:1 communications, especially as users change devices (and therefore encryption keys) over time;\\n1. Even harder in small groups, since eachpairof participants has a unique code (there are no “group” codes);\\n1. Is near-impossible to perform in large groups. Every time someone joins or leaves, enrolls a new companion device, changes their phone, etc. this needs to be redone for all participants. For example, in a group of 100 people, that’s 4950 pairs of security verifications.\\n\\nIdeally, this wouldn’t be a manual process and could be verified through some kind of automated flow.\\n\\nEnterkeytransparency: Aprotocol in which we establish an AKD on WhatsApp that maintains a record of public key changes. Additionally, we’ve established a third-party public repository of auditable change logs to the directory that updates whenever there’s additions to the directory. This is vital for transparency and to further strengthen our end-to-end encrypted guarantee. In effect, this confirms that the same public keys a user uses to contact a recipient are the same ones that everybody else also uses to communicate with the recipient.\\n\\nAlthough key transparency does not substitute QR code scanning, it enhances and complements it in the following ways:\\n\\n1. QR code scanning requires two people to coordinate out-of-band verification. In contrast, key transparency requires only a single client to initiate and perform a check against the directory, thus improving accessibility of the check process;\\n1. Key transparency serves as a public key consistency mechanism when manual QR code verification is impractical (for example in large group communication scenario);\\n1. It also serves as a lightweight first-check of end-to-end encryption, which improves adoption of end-to-end encryption checks to more users, benefiting messaging security at-large.\\n\\nIn the event that the automatic check returns a result showing that the connection may not be secure, we recommend users proceed with the manual security verification check.\\n\\n## The history of key transparency\\n\\nKey transparency describes a protocol in which the server maintains an append-only record of the mapping between a user’s account and their public identity key.This allows the generation ofinclusionproofs to assert that a given mapping exists in the directory at the time of the most recent update.\\n\\nWhatsApp’s realization of key transparency is based on the original academic works on key transparency, starting withCONIKSandSEEMless, with extensions from a recent paper calledParakeet. Together, this resulted in the RustAKDcrate, which serves as the foundation for maintaining a key transparency solution along with generating inclusion and key history proofs from the directory. WhatsApp is hosting this AKD directory as an infrastructure available to all of our users.\\n\\nPublic keys cannot be used to decrypt a user’s messages or determine who you’ve been talking to. They are, however, necessary to make sure that someone is sending a message to the intended recipient by encrypting messages that only the holder of the public key’s associated private key can read.\\n\\nA user may have many entries as they update their key over time. At WhatsApp’s scale this equates to billions of entries continually growing over time. When a user deletes their account, we remove all of the public keys for that account, but the fact a key existed at a point in time is immutable (we just can’t say what the key was).\\n\\n## How does key transparency work?\\n\\n### Security on principle\\n\\nFrom a core design choice, multiple factors helped us decide to enhance the openness and security of this project.First off, the AKD, with all of its proof generation and verification logic, is open-source code.This is aRust-based crate (library) for any entity that wants to manage an append-only directory with a publicly verifiable log or verify append-only audit proofs and participate as a public auditor of WhatsApp’s key transparency solution. A list of public keys alone cannot provide access to anyone’s content.\\n\\nThis library allows for the system to provide a significant guarantee on the correctness of the directory entries while not compromising security by being vulnerable to memory-based attacks. Additionally, we stuck with the decision to utilize Rust in most of the internal components outlined below.\\n\\n## Applying AKD to WhatsApp\\n\\n### High-volume key changes\\n\\nWhatsApp deals with tens of thousands of key changes (registration, re-registration, etc.) per minute. This kind of volume is difficult to deal with when trying to insert into an append-only log.\\n\\nTherefore, we decided to implement a distributed, high-throughput queue where “pending changes” live prior to being gathered together into a batch and inserted to form the next epoch. This allows us to do far larger batch inserts and greatly limits the number of database operations we need to make.\\n\\nSince the changes to the AKD are additive based on the previousepochwe need to make sure that only a single update occurs at a time. A single processor, sequentially handling each update one-by-one, wouldn’t be able to keep up with the rate of changes within WhatsApp (no matter the database implementation). This adds some latency from the time a key is added or updated to when it’s “published” in the directory.\\n\\nBy batching keys together and making anepocha collection of changes committed atomically, we can benefit from a lot of query optimizations due to many shared paths in the Merkle Tree stored in the database. The frequency to publish and emit newepochsis a tunable parameter that may be adjusted over time.\\n\\n### Public auditing at scale\\n\\nThe general requirement for all transparency solutions is to bepublicly auditable, meaning that anyone, should they want to, can verify the transactions on the directory to assert that:\\n\\n1. The history hasn’t been changed (existing records aren’t deleted or updated).\\n1. Changes are append-only.\\n\\nWhen publishing a new change to the AKD, we emit an audit proof of those changes that is put into public storage for anyone interested. These audit records guarantee the properties of immutable history for anyone to verify should they want to while preserving the privacy of all users in the directory.\\n\\nThis does not risk anyone’s actual info from being public, nor does it reveal any patterns of behavior for any users. You can read more about how this privacy guarantee works as outlined inSEEMlessandParakeet, the academic works from which key transparency is based off.\\n\\n## WhatsApp’s key transparency rollout\\n\\nKey transparency solutions help strengthen the guarantee that end-to-end encryption provides to private personal messaging applications in a transparent manner available to all. This technology underpins WhatsApp commitment and leadership in the security domain.\\n\\nWhatsApp is already hosting and operating an AKD for all of our users, regardless of the version or platform of the application you’re utilizing. Users who utilize the verify security code function will start to notice that the verification is automatic as this rolls out on Android in the coming months.* This is an important mechanism that empowers security-conscious users to verify an end-to-end encrypted personal conversation quickly.\\n\\n## Read the whitepaper\\n\\nRead theWhatsApp Key Transparency Overview whitepaperfor a more technical deep-dive that goes through potential attacks, additional details on data-flows, and formats.\\n\\n*UPDATE: Key Transparency is now fully available on WhatsApp for Android and iOS.\\n\\n### Share this:\\n\\n* Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook\\n* Click to share on Threads (Opens in new window)Threads\\n* Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X\\n* Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)LinkedIn\\n* Click to share on Hacker News (Opens in new window)Hacker News\\n* Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Email', 'title': 'Deploying key transparency at WhatsApp', 'url': 'https://engineering.fb.com/2023/04/13/security/whatsapp-key-transparency/'}]\n\nUSER'S SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n**Critically important: You must integrate the following user-specific directives into the email.

Private Cloud Compute makes it possible for users to take advantage of such models without sacrificing the security and privacy that they expect from Apple devices.\\n\\nWe designed Private Cloud Compute with core requirements that go beyond traditional models of cloud AI security:\\n\\n* Stateless computation on personal user data: PCC must use the personal user data that it receives exclusively for the purpose of fulfilling the user’s request. User data must not be accessible after the response is returned to the user.\\n* Enforceable guarantees: It must be possible to constrain and analyze all the components that critically contribute to the guarantees of the overall PCC system.\\n* No privileged runtime access: PCC must not contain privileged interfaces that might enable Apple site reliability staff to bypass PCC privacy guarantees.\\n* Non-targetability: An attacker should not be able to attempt to compromise personal data that belongs to specific, targeted PCC users without attempting a broad compromise of the entire PCC system.\\n* Verifiable transparency: Security researchers need to be able to verify, with a high degree of confidence, that our privacy and security guarantees for PCC match our public promises.\\n\\nStateless computation on personal user data: PCC must use the personal user data that it receives exclusively for the purpose of fulfilling the user’s request.

This enables anyone to verify audit proofs of the directory’s correctness. This underpins our key transparency deployment.\\n\\nEnd-to-end encryption is the foundation of private messaging on WhatsApp, helping to ensure that only you and the person you’re communicating with can read what’s sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp. It is among the most widely used deployments of end-to-end encryption and relies on public key cryptography first developed in the 1970s. From a technical point of view, for end-to-end encryption to be trusted, the “ends” of a conversation need to know that one another’s encryption keys are authentic and valid.\\n\\nTo do so, our most security conscious users have always been able to take advantage of oursecurity code verification featureavailable under a user’s contact info. When in person, keys can be validated with a quick QR code scan or, if remote, sharing the unique 60-digit code.\\n\\nThis is the one of the strongest ways of verifying if a connection is secure. But in reality we know that double checking a long code is cumbersome, and our team has been looking at ways to make this easier for some time.\\n\\nWe’re excited to introduce a new cryptographic security feature to automatically verify a secure connection without the need for this long code. To do so, we’re building on key transparency by developing a newAuditable Key Directory (AKD), which is based on anopen-sourced library. The AKD will enable WhatsApp clients to automatically validate that a user’s encryption key is genuine and enables anyone to verify audit proofs of the directory’s correctness.\\n\\nOur approach to key transparency is two-pronged and introduces two new components:\\n\\n1. The server (WhatsApp) maintains an append-only AKD of public keys mapped to user accounts.\\n1. A third-party audit record, wherein any change in the server directory is recorded in a publicly available, privacy-preserving audit record for anyone to verify.\\n\\nWith these two additions, users can automatically verify their conversation security thanks to the WhatsApp directory. As this is rolled out, security-conscious users who utilize the verify security code page will notice this verification process occurs quickly and automatically.\\n\\nThis system is a new service provided by WhatsApp that relies on public auditing to verify the end-to-end encryption status of personal conversations. While this system provides easy and convenient verification tools to our users, those who wish to verify their end-to-end encrypted sessions without utilizing WhatsApp servers at all are encouraged to utilize the traditional security code verification process in addition to this new automated process.\\n\\nThe public keys are only a tool that users have to encrypt their messages. The private key – which is used to decrypt messages – is on user devices. Nobody – not even WhatsApp – has access to those private keys. A list of public keys alone cannot provide access to anyone’s content.\\n\\n## How the “Verify Security Code” page works\\n\\nThe crux of end-to-end encrypted messaging is public/private key pairs. The private key is what you utilize to decrypt your messages sent from another party and never leaves your device. The public key, however, is what you give to others so they can encrypt messages. This is done by first giving the key to WhatsApp, where we store it on your behalf and give it to users who wish to message you.\\n\\nThe classic concern that end-to-end encryption was designed to guard against is a person-in-the-middle attack where youthinkyou’re talking to just one user; however, you’re actually talking to a middle-man attacker, who provides an incorrect public key so that they hold the private key and can read your messages. The attacker may then use the correct public key for your contact, re-encrypt the message with it, and send it to the user.What stops this today? WhatsApp has aSecurity Pagefor each contact that has a QR code and a 60-digit number that can be verified outside of WhatsApp to make sure it matches what your contact sees on their device. In short, it’s a unique hash of both your public keys and their public keys, so if either of you have the wrong value, the hashes won’t match. When they do match this confirms a secure, end-to-end encrypted conversation.\\n\\n## What’s the problem key transparency is fixing?\\n\\nWhile providing a strong guarantee of security, the QR code scanning/number matching feature requires communicating with your contacts outside of WhatsApp – whether it’s over a video-call, in real-life, on the phone, etc. This is:\\n\\n1. Difficult to do in 1:1 communications, especially as users change devices (and therefore encryption keys) over time;\\n1. Even harder in small groups, since eachpairof participants has a unique code (there are no “group” codes);\\n1. Is near-impossible to perform in large groups. Every time someone joins or leaves, enrolls a new companion device, changes their phone, etc. this needs to be redone for all participants. For example, in a group of 100 people, that’s 4950 pairs of security verifications.\\n\\nIdeally, this wouldn’t be a manual process and could be verified through some kind of automated flow.\\n\\nEnterkeytransparency: Aprotocol in which we establish an AKD on WhatsApp that maintains a record of public key changes. Additionally, we’ve established a third-party public repository of auditable change logs to the directory that updates whenever there’s additions to the directory. This is vital for transparency and to further strengthen our end-to-end encrypted guarantee. In effect, this confirms that the same public keys a user uses to contact a recipient are the same ones that everybody else also uses to communicate with the recipient.\\n\\nAlthough key transparency does not substitute QR code scanning, it enhances and complements it in the following ways:\\n\\n1. QR code scanning requires two people to coordinate out-of-band verification. In contrast, key transparency requires only a single client to initiate and perform a check against the directory, thus improving accessibility of the check process;\\n1. Key transparency serves as a public key consistency mechanism when manual QR code verification is impractical (for example in large group communication scenario);\\n1. It also serves as a lightweight first-check of end-to-end encryption, which improves adoption of end-to-end encryption checks to more users, benefiting messaging security at-large.\\n\\nIn the event that the automatic check returns a result showing that the connection may not be secure, we recommend users proceed with the manual security verification check.\\n\\n## The history of key transparency\\n\\nKey transparency describes a protocol in which the server maintains an append-only record of the mapping between a user’s account and their public identity key.This allows the generation ofinclusionproofs to assert that a given mapping exists in the directory at the time of the most recent update.\\n\\nWhatsApp’s realization of key transparency is based on the original academic works on key transparency, starting withCONIKSandSEEMless, with extensions from a recent paper calledParakeet. Together, this resulted in the RustAKDcrate, which serves as the foundation for maintaining a key transparency solution along with generating inclusion and key history proofs from the directory. WhatsApp is hosting this AKD directory as an infrastructure available to all of our users.\\n\\nPublic keys cannot be used to decrypt a user’s messages or determine who you’ve been talking to. They are, however, necessary to make sure that someone is sending a message to the intended recipient by encrypting messages that only the holder of the public key’s associated private key can read.\\n\\nA user may have many entries as they update their key over time. At WhatsApp’s scale this equates to billions of entries continually growing over time. When a user deletes their account, we remove all of the public keys for that account, but the fact a key existed at a point in time is immutable (we just can’t say what the key was).\\n\\n## How does key transparency work?\\n\\n### Security on principle\\n\\nFrom a core design choice, multiple factors helped us decide to enhance the openness and security of this project.First off, the AKD, with all of its proof generation and verification logic, is open-source code.This is aRust-based crate (library) for any entity that wants to manage an append-only directory with a publicly verifiable log or verify append-only audit proofs and participate as a public auditor of WhatsApp’s key transparency solution. A list of public keys alone cannot provide access to anyone’s content.\\n\\nThis library allows for the system to provide a significant guarantee on the correctness of the directory entries while not compromising security by being vulnerable to memory-based attacks. Additionally, we stuck with the decision to utilize Rust in most of the internal components outlined below.\\n\\n## Applying AKD to WhatsApp\\n\\n### High-volume key changes\\n\\nWhatsApp deals with tens of thousands of key changes (registration, re-registration, etc.) per minute. This kind of volume is difficult to deal with when trying to insert into an append-only log.\\n\\nTherefore, we decided to implement a distributed, high-throughput queue where “pending changes” live prior to being gathered together into a batch and inserted to form the next epoch. This allows us to do far larger batch inserts and greatly limits the number of database operations we need to make.\\n\\nSince the changes to the AKD are additive based on the previousepochwe need to make sure that only a single update occurs at a time. A single processor, sequentially handling each update one-by-one, wouldn’t be able to keep up with the rate of changes within WhatsApp (no matter the database implementation). This adds some latency from the time a key is added or updated to when it’s “published” in the directory.\\n\\nBy batching keys together and making anepocha collection of changes committed atomically, we can benefit from a lot of query optimizations due to many shared paths in the Merkle Tree stored in the database. The frequency to publish and emit newepochsis a tunable parameter that may be adjusted over time.\\n\\n### Public auditing at scale\\n\\nThe general requirement for all transparency solutions is to bepublicly auditable, meaning that anyone, should they want to, can verify the transactions on the directory to assert that:\\n\\n1. The history hasn’t been changed (existing records aren’t deleted or updated).\\n1. Changes are append-only.\\n\\nWhen publishing a new change to the AKD, we emit an audit proof of those changes that is put into public storage for anyone interested. These audit records guarantee the properties of immutable history for anyone to verify should they want to while preserving the privacy of all users in the directory.\\n\\nThis does not risk anyone’s actual info from being public, nor does it reveal any patterns of behavior for any users. You can read more about how this privacy guarantee works as outlined inSEEMlessandParakeet, the academic works from which key transparency is based off.\\n\\n## WhatsApp’s key transparency rollout\\n\\nKey transparency solutions help strengthen the guarantee that end-to-end encryption provides to private personal messaging applications in a transparent manner available to all. This technology underpins WhatsApp commitment and leadership in the security domain.\\n\\nWhatsApp is already hosting and operating an AKD for all of our users, regardless of the version or platform of the application you’re utilizing. Users who utilize the verify security code function will start to notice that the verification is automatic as this rolls out on Android in the coming months.* This is an important mechanism that empowers security-conscious users to verify an end-to-end encrypted personal conversation quickly.\\n\\n## Read the whitepaper\\n\\nRead theWhatsApp Key Transparency Overview whitepaperfor a more technical deep-dive that goes through potential attacks, additional details on data-flows, and formats.\\n\\n*UPDATE: Key Transparency is now fully available on WhatsApp for Android and iOS.\\n\\n### Share this:\\n\\n* Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook\\n* Click to share on Threads (Opens in new window)Threads\\n* Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X\\n* Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)LinkedIn\\n* Click to share on Hacker News (Opens in new window)Hacker News\\n* Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Email', 'title': 'Deploying key transparency at WhatsApp', 'url': 'https://engineering.fb.com/2023/04/13/security/whatsapp-key-transparency/'}]\n\nUSER'S SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n**Critically important: You must integrate the following user-specific directives into the email. These instructions override any conflicting general advice.**\nI’m partially blind and I have a guide dog\n\n\n------\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. **FIND COMMON GROUND (OR CREATE IT)**: Analyze the recruiter's background deeply to identify shared elements.\n   - Primary targets: Same university, previous companies, mutual connections, shared professional groups.\n   - **Fallback strategy**: If no direct common ground exists, identify a specific, non-generic aspect of their career you genuinely admire (e.g., an article they wrote, a talk they gave, their transition from one industry to another).\n\n2. **LEAD WITH A STRATEGIC SUBJECT LINE**: Create a subject line that is both professional and intriguing, ideally hinting at the common ground or a key value proposition. *Example: \"Fellow [University Name] Alum & Data Scientist\" or \"Question about your work at [Previous Company]\"*.\n\n3. **LEAD WITH CONNECTION**: Start the email's first sentence by mentioning the most compelling commonality naturally. Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

design and engineering effort, spanning half a decade, that combines the unique strengths of Apple silicon hardware with our advanced operating system security to provide industry-first, always-on memory safety protection across our devices — without compromising our best-in-class device performance. We believe Memory Integrity Enforcement represents the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems.\\n\\nThere has never been a successful, widespread malware attack against iPhone. The only system-level iOS attacks we observe in the wild come from mercenary spyware, which is vastly more complex than regular cybercriminal activity and consumer malware. Mercenary spyware is historically associated with state actors and uses exploit chains that cost millions of dollars to target a very small number of specific individuals and their devices. Although the vast majority of users will never be targeted in this way, these exploit chains demonstrate some of the most expensive, complex, and advanced attacker capabilities at any given time and are uniquely deserving of study as we work to protect iPhone users against even the most sophisticated threats. Known mercenary spyware chains used against iOS share a common denominator with those targeting Windows and Android: they exploit memory safety vulnerabilities, which are interchangeable, powerful, and exist throughout the industry.\\n\\nFor Apple, improving memory safety is a broad effort that includes developing with safe languages and deploying mitigations at scale. (For a primer on how we think about memory safety, see the opening ofthis post.) We created Swift, an easy-to-use, memory-safe language, which we employ for new code and targeted component rewrites. In iOS 15, we introducedkalloc_type, a secure memory allocator for the kernel, followed in iOS 17 by its user-level counterpart, xzone malloc. These secure allocators take advantage of knowing the type — or purpose — of allocations so that memory can be organized in a way that makes exploiting most memory corruption vulnerabilities inherently difficult.\\n\\nIn 2018, we were the first in the industry to deploy Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC) in the A12 Bionic chip, to protect code flow integrity in the presence of memory corruption. The strong success of this defensive mechanism in increasing exploitation complexity left no doubt that the deep integration of software and hardware security would be key to addressing some of our greatest security challenges. With PAC behind us, we immediately began design and evaluation work to find the most effective way to build sophisticated memory safety capabilities right into Apple silicon.\\n\\nArm published theMemory Tagging Extension (MTE)specification in 2019 as a tool for hardware to help find memory corruption bugs. MTE is, at its core, a memory tagging and tag-checking system, where every memory allocation is tagged with a secret; the hardware guarantees that later requests to access memory are granted only if the request contains the correct secret. If the secrets don’t match, the app crashes, and the event is logged. This allows developers to identify memory corruption bugs immediately as they occur.\\n\\nWe conducted a deep evaluation and research process to determine whether MTE, as designed, would meet our goals for hardware-assisted memory safety. Our analysis found that, when employed as a real-time defensive measure, the original Arm MTE release exhibited weaknesses that were unacceptable to us, and we worked with Arm to address these shortcomings in the newEnhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE)specification, released in 2022. More importantly, our analysis showed that while EMTE had great potential as specified, a rigorous implementation with deep hardware and operating system support could be a breakthrough that produces an extraordinary new security mechanism.\\n\\nConsider that MTE can beconfiguredto report memory corruption either synchronously or asynchronously. In the latter mode, memory corruption doesn’t immediately raise an exception, leaving a race window open for attackers. We would not implement such a mechanism. We believe memory safety protections need to be strictly synchronous, on by default, and working continuously. But supporting always-on, synchronous MTE across key attack surfaces while preserving a great, high-performance user experience is extremely demanding on hardware.\\n\\nIn addition, for MTE to provide memory safety in an adversarial context, we would need to finely tune the operating system to defend the new semantics and the confidentiality of memory tags on which MTE relies. Ultimately, we determined that to deliver truly best-in-class memory safety, we would carry out a massive engineering effort spanning all of Apple — including updates to Apple silicon, our operating systems, and our software frameworks. This effort, together with our highly successful secure memory allocator work, would transform MTE from a helpful debugging tool into a groundbreaking new security feature.\\n\\nToday we’re introducing the culmination of this effort: Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE), our comprehensive memory safety defense for Apple platforms. Memory Integrity Enforcement is built on the robust foundation provided by oursecure memory allocators, coupled withEnhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE)in synchronous mode, and supported by extensiveTag Confidentiality Enforcementpolicies. MIE is built right into Apple hardware and software in all models of iPhone 17 and iPhone Air and offers unparalleled, always-on memory safety protection for our key attack surfaces including the kernel, while maintaining the power and performance that users expect. In addition, we’re making EMTE available to all Apple developers in Xcode as part of the newEnhanced Securityfeature that we released earlier this year during WWDC.\\n\\nThe rest of this post dives into the intensive engineering effort required to design and validate Memory Integrity Enforcement.\\n\\n### Designing Memory Integrity Enforcement\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement starts with our secure memory allocators — kalloc_type, xzone malloc, and WebKit’s libpas — all of which usetype informationto decide how to organize memory allocations. With both use-after-free and out-of-bounds bugs, an attacker’s goal is to create overlapping interpretations of memory, which they achieve by controlling the precise position of certain allocations — of a specific type — that is advantageous to them. The type-aware placement policies of our secure memory allocators help thwart these memory corruption techniques, as we described in ourkalloc_type post. Our secure allocators set a new high-water mark of software protection against memory corruption, while preserving the same or better performance as the allocators they replaced.\\n\\nAllocators can apply protections only at the granularity of memory pages — 16KB on iOS — which is a natural fit for multi-page allocations. For smaller allocations, our secure allocators can use page-level protections to help prevent memory corruption attacks across different type buckets. However, page-level protections are too coarse to defend against attacks within the same type bucket, and we use memory tagging to close this gap.\\n\\nLet’s look at how EMTE can be used to protect against two of the most common types of memory corruption: buffer overflows and use-after-free vulnerabilities. For buffer overflows, the allocator is responsible for using different tags for neighboring allocations. If a request to access memory spills over to adjacent memory that has a different tag, the hardware blocks it, and the operating system can take action and terminate the process. We represent this visually below with three adjacent allocations, tagged with three different secrets: ⏺️, 🔼, and ⏹️. Two access attempts with the 🔼 tag are permitted to 🔼-tagged memory, but the third attempt is blocked as it spills over into the adjacent, ⏹️-tagged allocation.\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement blocks buffer overflows\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement blocks buffer overflows\\n\\nThe allocator is also responsible for retagging memory as it gets reused for other purposes. In the image below, the 🔼 allocation is retagged as ⏹️ after it has been freed and reallocated by the system. If a request to the retagged memory is made with the older 🔼 tag, as would be seen in use-after-free exploits, the hardware blocks it and lets the operating system take further action.\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement blocks use-after-free access\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement blocks use-after-free access\\n\\nA key weakness of the original MTE specification is that access to non-tagged memory, such as global variables, is not checked by the hardware. This means attackers don’t have to face as many defensive constraints when attempting to control core application configuration and state. With Enhanced MTE, we instead specify that accessing non-tagged memory from a tagged memory region requires knowing that region’s tag, making it significantly harder for attackers to turn out-of-bounds bugs in dynamic tagged memory into a way to sidestep EMTE by directly modifying non-tagged allocations.\\n\\nFinally, we developedTag Confidentiality Enforcementto protect the implementation of our secure allocators from technical threats and to guard the confidentiality of EMTE tags — including against side-channel and speculative-execution attacks.\\n\\nOur typed allocators and EMTE both rely on confidentiality of kernel data structures from user applications, and of the tags chosen by the allocator. Attackers might attempt to defeat EMTE, and in turn Memory Integrity Enforcement, by revealing these secrets. To protect the kernel allocator backing store and tag storage, we use theSecure Page Table Monitor, which provides strong guarantees even in the presence of a kernel compromise. We also ensure that when the kernel accesses memory on behalf of an application, it's subject to the same tag-checking rules as userspace.\\n\\nAttacks based on speculative execution can also be used to expose secrets. To improve performance, modern CPUs predict the execution of instructions that follow prior, potentially longer latency instructions. If the prediction is correct, computation is very fast. If it’s wrong, the CPU discards the prediction, and computation is slower. Unfortunately, discarded predictions have observable effects that can reveal system state and data, and because speculative attacks never cause the system to crash or misbehave in observable ways during their use, they’re particularly useful for an attacker. For example, evaluating a pointer authentication instruction speculatively exposedtiming differencesin our original implementation of Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC), which would allow the valid signature to be isolated. During the design phase for Memory Integrity Enforcement, we identified and addressed the three speculative vulnerabilities that could undermine tag confidentiality.\\n\\nFirst, when EMTE is active, requests to access memory cause the hardware to check tags. It's crucial that evaluating a tag-checking instruction speculatively doesn’t expose timing differences that would allow an attacker to isolate the valid tag. From the start, we designed the Apple silicon implementation so that tag values can’t influence speculative execution in any way.  Recently published security research (StickyTags,TikTag) demonstrates that the MTE implementation on Google’s Pixel devices is vulnerable to this type of attack, allowing MTE to be bypassed in Google Chrome and the Linux kernel.\\n\\nSecond, allocators assign random tags to memory, and attackers must not be able to predict tag values that the system will choose. We address this issue by frequently re-seeding the underlying pseudo-random generator used to select new tags.\\n\\nThird,Spectre variant 1 (V1)is a speculative-execution vulnerability that allows attackers to exploit conditional branches to leak data, including MTE tag values. To date, there has been no solution to this problem in consumer operating systems, because general Spectre V1 mitigations such asSpeculative Load Hardeninghave a prohibitive CPU cost. The presence of EMTE leaves Spectre V1 as one of the last avenues available to attackers to help guide their attacks, so we designed a mitigation that limits the effective reach of Spectre V1 leaks at virtually zero CPU cost. This mitigation forces attackers to contend with type segregation, through ideas similar to VUSec’sTDI, making it impractical to exploit Spectre V1. The result is that attackers would typically need 25 or more V1 sequences to reach more than 95 percent exploitability rate — unless one of these sequences is related to the bug being exploited, following similar reasoning as ourkalloc_type analysis.\\n\\nOur mission with Memory Integrity Enforcement is to protect all users by default and provide an extraordinary disruption to the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities. To do so, we considered a wide set of threats, including some of the most challenging ones — such as side channels — and arrived at this extensive combination of features not present in other MTE implementations. Google took a great first step last year when they offered MTE to those who opt in to their program for at-risk users. But even for users who turn it on, the effectiveness of MTE on Android is limited by the lack of deep integration with the operating system that distinguishes Memory Integrity Enforcement and its use of EMTE on Apple silicon.\\n\\nFor the new A19 and A19 Pro chips to support Memory Integrity Enforcement, we dedicated an extraordinary amount of Apple silicon resources to security — more than ever before — including CPU area, CPU speed, and memory for tag storage. And to fully realize this hardware investment, we designed all of the new operating system elements of MIE jointly with our hardware work, including secure allocators, EMTE, and tag confidentiality protections.\\n\\nBecause EMTE tag checking imposes a performance cost, we designed Memory Integrity Enforcement to take advantage of our secure allocators first and use EMTE to protect only smaller individual allocations within a type bucket, which software allocators can’t defend on their own. Then, by knowing where and how we would deploy EMTE, we could accurately model the tag-checking demand of the operating system, and design our silicon to satisfy it. Our hardware implementation influenced additional software design decisions, reducing the overhead of tag checks even further. Importantly, deploying EMTE with this level of precision supports our strategy to provide as many memory safety improvements as possible to users on previous iPhone generations, which don’t support EMTE.\\n\\nFor the security evaluation of Memory Integrity Enforcement, we involved our offensive research team from the very beginning. From 2020 to 2025, they continuously analyzed and attacked the system — first conceptually, with theoretical exploitation avenues, then with practical attacks in simulated environments, and eventually on new hardware prototypes. Prolonged engagement from our offensive research team allowed us to identify and eradicate entire attack strategies and techniques before attackers could ever discover them, leading to a stronger, more mature feature from the outset.\\n\\nOur offensive research team identified where and how attackers are most likely to break into the system, and our deployment of Memory Integrity Enforcement is deeply guided by their findings. Notably, this includes making sure that this powerful new protection is available to third-party apps that are likely entry points for attackers — such as social networks, messaging apps, or any other app where a specific user can be targeted. Starting immediately with the launch of MIE, any developer can begin testing this powerful protection for their app, including EMTE on hardware that supports it, using theEnhanced Securitysettings in Xcode.\\n\\nThe meticulous planning and implementation of Memory Integrity Enforcement made it possible to maintain synchronous tag checking for all the demanding workloads of our platforms, delivering groundbreaking security with minimal performance impact, while remaining completely invisible to users.\\n\\n### Security evaluation\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement started with a deeply ambitious goal: to make it immensely more expensive and difficult to develop and maintain mercenary spyware attacks based on memory corruption against our platforms. While there’s no such thing as perfect security, MIE is designed to dramatically constrain attackers and their degrees of freedom during exploitation.\\n\\nThroughout the design and implementation of Memory Integrity Enforcement, our offensive research team evaluated our progress by looking at sophisticated exploit chains that were previously used against our platform, recent vulnerabilities, and our own internal research. First, we worked on rebuilding and adapting previously seen exploit chains to systems protected by MIE. But it’s not sufficient to consider only previous chains that were developed before MIE existed, because attackers will surely adapt in reaction to these new protections. We therefore also evaluated a selection of more recent vulnerabilities that we expected would have the best chance of surviving MIE. For these, we meticulously enumerated all possible exploitation opportunities, similar to our evaluation ofSockPuppet against kalloc_type.\\n\\nBoth approaches revealed the same conclusion: Memory Integrity Enforcement vastly reduces the exploitation strategies available to attackers. Though memory corruption bugs are usually interchangeable, MIE cut off so many exploit steps at a fundamental level that it was not possible to restore the chains by swapping in new bugs. Even with substantial effort, we could not rebuild any of these chains to work around MIE. The few memory corruption effects that remained are unreliable and don’t give attackers sufficient momentum to successfully exploit these bugs.\\n\\nHere’s a visual representation of what this looks like for an attacker. The chart below represents six of the real-world exploit chains that we evaluated and shows the steps where Memory Integrity Enforcement — the secure allocators, EMTE, or both — stops the attack.\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement vs. real-world exploit chains\\n\\nMemory Integrity Enforcement vs. real-world exploit chains\\n\\nNotably, attackers confront Memory Integrity Enforcement early in the exploitation process. Although some issues are able to survive MIE — for example, intra-allocation buffer overflows — such issues are extremely rare, and even fewer will lend themselves to a full end-to-end exploit. Inevitably, attackers must face MIE at a stage where their capabilities are still very limited, leaving few viable avenues for exploitation. This leads to fragile chains where breaking just one step is often enough to invalidate the entire exploit strategy. When that happens, most of the chain’s components can’t be reused, and the attackers have to restart exploit development with entirely new bugs.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe industry-leading security of iPhone means that the vast majority of our users never face system-level attacks on their devices. Our work on memory safety is aimed primarily at the mercenary spyware and surveillance industry, which spends many millions of dollars to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities and target a small number of individuals because of who they are and what they do. Over the past five years, we developed a comprehensive approach to memory safety that integrates the best of our hardware and software capabilities, and today’s announcement is the culmination of this ambitious vision. With the introduction of the iPhone 17 lineup and iPhone Air, we’re excited to deliver Memory Integrity Enforcement: the industry’s first ever, comprehensive, always-on memory-safety protection covering key attack surfaces — including the kernel and over 70 userland processes — built on the Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE) and supported by secure typed allocators and tag confidentiality protections.\\n\\nBased on our evaluations pitting Memory Integrity Enforcement against exceptionally sophisticated mercenary spyware attacks from the last three years, we believe MIE will make exploit chains significantly more expensive and difficult to develop and maintain, disrupt many of the most effective exploitation techniques from the last 25 years, and completely redefine the landscape of memory safety for Apple products. Because of how dramatically it reduces an attacker’s ability to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities on our devices, we believe Memory Integrity Enforcement represents the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems.\", 'title': 'Memory Integrity Enforcement: A complete vision for memory safety in Apple devices - Apple Security Research', 'url': 'https://security.apple.com/blog/memory-integrity-enforcement/'}, {'markdown': '# Apple expands industry-leading commitment to protect users from highly targeted mercenary spyware\\n\\n* Messages: Most message attachment types other than images are blocked.

Apple is also providing details of its $10 million grant to bolster research exposing such threats.Apple today detailed two initiatives to help protect users who may be personally targeted by some of the most sophisticated digital threats, such as those from private companies developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware. Lockdown Mode — the first major capability of its kind, coming this fall with iOS 16, iPadOS 16, and macOS Ventura — is an extreme, optional protection for the very small number of users who face grave, targeted threats to their digital security. Apple also shared details about the $10 million cybersecurity grant it announced last November to support civil society organizations that conduct mercenary spyware threat research and advocacy.“Apple makes the most secure mobile devices on the market. Lockdown Mode is a groundbreaking capability that reflects our unwavering commitment to protecting users from even the rarest, most sophisticated attacks,” said Ivan Krstić, Apple’s head of Security Engineering and Architecture. “While the vast majority of users will never be the victims of highly targeted cyberattacks, we will work tirelessly to protect the small number of users who are. That includes continuing to design defenses specifically for these users, as well as supporting researchers and organizations around the world doing critically important work in exposing mercenary companies that create these digital attacks.”Lockdown Mode offers an extreme, optional level of security for the very few users who, because of who they are or what they do, may be personally targeted by some of the most sophisticated digital threats, such as those from NSO Group and other private companies developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware. Turning on Lockdown Mode in iOS 16, iPadOS 16, and macOS Ventura further hardens device defenses and strictly limits certain functionalities, sharply reducing the attack surface that potentially could be exploited by highly targeted mercenary spyware.At launch, Lockdown Mode includes the following protections:Messages: Most message attachment types other than images are blocked. Some features, like link previews, are disabled.Web browsing: Certain complex web technologies, like just-in-time (JIT) JavaScript compilation, are disabled unless the user excludes a trusted site from Lockdown Mode.Apple services: Incoming invitations and service requests, including FaceTime calls, are blocked if the user has not previously sent the initiator a call or request.Wired connections with a computer or accessory are blocked when iPhone is locked.Configuration profiles cannot be installed, and the device cannot enroll into mobile device management (MDM), while Lockdown Mode is turned on.Apple will continue to strengthen Lockdown Mode and add new protections to it over time. To invite feedback and collaboration from the security research community, Apple has also established a new category within the Apple Security Bounty program to reward researchers who find Lockdown Mode bypasses and help improve its protections. Bounties are doubled for qualifying findings in Lockdown Mode, up to a maximum of $2,000,000 — the highest maximum bounty payout in the industry.Apple is also making a $10 million grant, in addition to any damages awarded from the lawsuit filed against NSO Group, to support organizations that investigate, expose, and prevent highly targeted cyberattacks, including those created by private companies developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware. The grant will be made to theDignity and Justice Fundestablished and advised by the Ford Foundation — a private foundation dedicated to advancing equity worldwide — and designed to pool philanthropic resources to advance social justice globally. The Dignity and Justice Fund is a fiscally sponsored project of the New Venture Fund, a 501(c)(3) public charity.“The global spyware trade targets human rights defenders, journalists, and dissidents; it facilitates violence, reinforces authoritarianism, and supports political repression,” said Lori McGlinchey, the Ford Foundation’s director of its Technology and Society program. “The Ford Foundation is proud to support this extraordinary initiative to bolster civil society research and advocacy to resist mercenary spyware.

Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"
