now ready for production with new aspect ratios\\n\\n* Facebook\\n* Twitter\\n* LinkedIn\\n* Mail\\n\\nOur state-of-the-art image generation and editing model which has captured the imagination of the world, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image 🍌, is now generally available, ready for production environments, and comes with new features like a wider range of aspect ratios in addition to being able to specify image-only output.\\n\\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image empowers users to seamlessly blend multiple images, maintain consistent characters for richer storytelling, perform targeted edits with natural language, and leverage Gemini\\'s extensive world knowledge for image generation and modification. The model is accessible through theGemini APIonGoogle AI Studioand onVertex AIfor enterprise use.\\n\\nFurther expanding creative possibilities, the model now supports 10 different aspect ratios. This allows for effortless content creation across various formats, from cinematic landscapes to vertical social media posts.\\n\\nSupported ratios include:\\n\\n* Landscape: 21:9, 16:9, 4:3, 3:2\\n* Square: 1:1\\n* Portrait: 9:16, 3:4, 2:3\\n* Flexible: 5:4, 4:5\\n\\n## What people are building\\n\\nCartwheelis harnessing AI to move beyond the \"slot machine user experience\" of many image generators, giving artists direct control to bring their creative vision to life. After months of building their \"Pose Mode\" feature and finding that other models failed to deliver, the team found a solution in the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. By combining Cartwheel\\'s 3D posing tool with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, they have created a powerful new image creation system that delivers unparalleled character control and consistency.\\n\\n“Other models couldn\\'t render characters from arbitrary camera angles or maintain faithfulness to a pose without sacrificing \"world knowledge\". The new Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model was the first that could provide both.” -Andrew Carr, Co-founder of Cartwheel\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nVolley, the creators of the AI powered dungeon crawler Wit\\'s End, use Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to generate and edit visuals in-session—character portraits, dynamic scene stills, multi-character compositions, and quick iterative edits from chat or voice.\\n\\n“The model demonstrates state-of-the-art rule-following to aesthetic guidance while retaining latency under <10s, unlocking many live applications, for example, letting players select styles and refine outputs in multi-turn loops.” - James Wilsterman, CTO at Volley\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nIt\\'s been incredible to see the community\\'s creativity in action during recent hackathons withKaggleandCerebral Valley, which saw hundreds of submissions showcasing the model\\'s capabilities in diverse fields like STEM education, marketing collateral, and real-time augmented reality.\\n\\n## Start building\\n\\nDevelopers can begin building with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image today. Check out thedeveloper docsandcookbookfor guidance on the new features, including the expanded aspect ratios and the ability to specify image-only output. The model is available via theGemini APIand for testing inGoogle AI Studio.\\n\\nBuilding with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is easy with Google AI Studio’s “build mode.” Instantly create and remix custom AI-powered apps from a single prompt, like \"Build me an image editing app with filters.\" When you\\'re ready, deploy your creation directly from AI Studio or save the code to GitHub—all for free. Try out and remix some of our example apps:\\n\\n* Bananimate: Create animated GIFs with Nano Banana from your images and prompts.\\n* Enhance: Infinitely zoom into any photography with our creative upscaler. See if you can find the easter-egg (hint: 🍌)\\n* Fit check: Upload a photo of yourself and an outfit to see how it looks on you. A virtual fitting room powered by Nano Banana.\\n\\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image is priced at $0.039 per image, with a rate of $30.00 per 1 million output tokens. Pricing for other input and output modalities aligns with the standard Gemini 2.5 Flashpricing.\\n\\nHere is a sample code to get you started:\\n\\n```\\nfromgoogleimportgenaifromgoogle.genaiimporttypesfromPILimportImage\\n\\nclient=genai.Client()prompt=\"Create a photograph of the subject in this image as if they were living in the 1980s.

This is the first Gemini Robotics model to be made broadly available. It acts as a high-level reasoning model for a robot.\\n\\nThis model specializes in capabilities critical for robotics, including visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. It can also natively call tools, likeGoogle Searchto find information, and can call a vision-language-action model (VLA) or any other third-party user-defined functions to execute the task.\\n\\nYou can get started building with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 today in preview viaGoogle AI Studioand the Gemini API.\\n\\nThis model is designed for tasks that are notoriously challenging for robots. Imagine asking a robot, “Can you sort these objects into the correct compost, recycling and trash bins?\" To complete this task, the robot needs to look up the local recycling guidelines on the internet, understand the objects in front of it and figure out how to sort them based on local rules, then do all the steps to complete putting them away. Most daily tasks, like this one, take contextual information and multiple steps to complete.\\n\\nGemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is the first thinking model optimized for this kind of embodied reasoning.

now ready for production with new aspect ratios\\n\\n* Facebook\\n* Twitter\\n* LinkedIn\\n* Mail\\n\\nOur state-of-the-art image generation and editing model which has captured the imagination of the world, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image 🍌, is now generally available, ready for production environments, and comes with new features like a wider range of aspect ratios in addition to being able to specify image-only output.\\n\\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image empowers users to seamlessly blend multiple images, maintain consistent characters for richer storytelling, perform targeted edits with natural language, and leverage Gemini\\'s extensive world knowledge for image generation and modification. The model is accessible through theGemini APIonGoogle AI Studioand onVertex AIfor enterprise use.\\n\\nFurther expanding creative possibilities, the model now supports 10 different aspect ratios. This allows for effortless content creation across various formats, from cinematic landscapes to vertical social media posts.\\n\\nSupported ratios include:\\n\\n* Landscape: 21:9, 16:9, 4:3, 3:2\\n* Square: 1:1\\n* Portrait: 9:16, 3:4, 2:3\\n* Flexible: 5:4, 4:5\\n\\n## What people are building\\n\\nCartwheelis harnessing AI to move beyond the \"slot machine user experience\" of many image generators, giving artists direct control to bring their creative vision to life. After months of building their \"Pose Mode\" feature and finding that other models failed to deliver, the team found a solution in the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. By combining Cartwheel\\'s 3D posing tool with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, they have created a powerful new image creation system that delivers unparalleled character control and consistency.\\n\\n“Other models couldn\\'t render characters from arbitrary camera angles or maintain faithfulness to a pose without sacrificing \"world knowledge\". The new Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model was the first that could provide both.” -Andrew Carr, Co-founder of Cartwheel\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nVolley, the creators of the AI powered dungeon crawler Wit\\'s End, use Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to generate and edit visuals in-session—character portraits, dynamic scene stills, multi-character compositions, and quick iterative edits from chat or voice.\\n\\n“The model demonstrates state-of-the-art rule-following to aesthetic guidance while retaining latency under <10s, unlocking many live applications, for example, letting players select styles and refine outputs in multi-turn loops.” - James Wilsterman, CTO at Volley\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nIt\\'s been incredible to see the community\\'s creativity in action during recent hackathons withKaggleandCerebral Valley, which saw hundreds of submissions showcasing the model\\'s capabilities in diverse fields like STEM education, marketing collateral, and real-time augmented reality.\\n\\n## Start building\\n\\nDevelopers can begin building with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image today. Check out thedeveloper docsandcookbookfor guidance on the new features, including the expanded aspect ratios and the ability to specify image-only output. The model is available via theGemini APIand for testing inGoogle AI Studio.\\n\\nBuilding with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is easy with Google AI Studio’s “build mode.” Instantly create and remix custom AI-powered apps from a single prompt, like \"Build me an image editing app with filters.\" When you\\'re ready, deploy your creation directly from AI Studio or save the code to GitHub—all for free. Try out and remix some of our example apps:\\n\\n* Bananimate: Create animated GIFs with Nano Banana from your images and prompts.\\n* Enhance: Infinitely zoom into any photography with our creative upscaler. See if you can find the easter-egg (hint: 🍌)\\n* Fit check: Upload a photo of yourself and an outfit to see how it looks on you. A virtual fitting room powered by Nano Banana.\\n\\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image is priced at $0.039 per image, with a rate of $30.00 per 1 million output tokens. Pricing for other input and output modalities aligns with the standard Gemini 2.5 Flashpricing.\\n\\nHere is a sample code to get you started:\\n\\n```\\nfromgoogleimportgenaifromgoogle.genaiimporttypesfromPILimportImage\\n\\nclient=genai.Client()prompt=\"Create a photograph of the subject in this image as if they were living in the 1980s.

This is the first Gemini Robotics model to be made broadly available. It acts as a high-level reasoning model for a robot.\\n\\nThis model specializes in capabilities critical for robotics, including visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. It can also natively call tools, likeGoogle Searchto find information, and can call a vision-language-action model (VLA) or any other third-party user-defined functions to execute the task.\\n\\nYou can get started building with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 today in preview viaGoogle AI Studioand the Gemini API.\\n\\nThis model is designed for tasks that are notoriously challenging for robots. Imagine asking a robot, “Can you sort these objects into the correct compost, recycling and trash bins?\" To complete this task, the robot needs to look up the local recycling guidelines on the internet, understand the objects in front of it and figure out how to sort them based on local rules, then do all the steps to complete putting them away. Most daily tasks, like this one, take contextual information and multiple steps to complete.\\n\\nGemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is the first thinking model optimized for this kind of embodied reasoning.

      "Subject: Bridging Game Design & AI Innovation at Google – Let’s Connect  \n\nHi Lauren,  \n\nAs a fellow advocate for blending creativity and technology (your work in game theory and design aligns with my passion for video game development), I wanted to reach out regarding opportunities at Google. Your expertise in talent strategy for tech teams—paired with Google’s breakthroughs like Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 and Veo 3’s 9:16 video capabilities—resonates deeply with my work at Dotdotdot, where I’ve engineered React.js-powered web apps and led UI/UX design for immersive digital experiences.  \n\nI’ve been inspired by Google’s push to enhance creative tools like Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, particularly how Cartwheel leverages it for character consistency—a challenge I’ve tackled firsthand in 3D modeling and game design projects. With expertise in full-stack development (Python, JavaScript) and a focus on user-centric design, I’m eager to contribute to initiatives that empower creators through cutting-edge AI.  \n\nGiven your background in fostering tech talent across Europe (I’m based in Milan, completing my Computer Engineering degree at Politecnico Di Milano), I’d love to discuss how my hybrid technical and creative skill set could align with Google’s innovation roadmap. Would you be open to a brief virtual coffee chat this week?  \n\nBest regards,  \nAlessio Antonucci",
      "Subject: Bridging European Tech Talent & Google’s Creative AI Vision  \n\nHi Lauren,  \n\nAs a Computer Engineering student at Politecnico di Milano with hands-on software development experience at Dotdotdot (Milan’s award-winning design/tech studio), I’ve been closely following Google’s breakthroughs in creative AI tools like Gemini 2.5 Flash Image – particularly how teams are applying its aspect ratio flexibility and character consistency to redefine interactive storytelling.  \n\nYour unique background bridging mathematics, organizational psychology, and technical talent development at Google/Adobe caught my attention. With my combined foundation in full-stack development (React, Python, C#) and human-centered design projects (including interactive installations and game prototypes), I believe I could contribute meaningfully to teams shaping tools that democratize creative expression – especially given Google’s expanded focus on multimodal AI applications as highlighted in recent developer blog updates.  \n\nWould you have 15 minutes to discuss how emerging European tech talent might align with Google’s innovation pipeline in London or Milan? I’m particularly curious about how you see cross-functional teams balancing rapid AI advancements with thoughtful UX – a challenge I navigated firsthand while optimizing AR interfaces for accessibility at Dotdotdot.  \n\nLooking forward to your insights,  \nAlessio Antonucci  \nPolitecnico di Milano ‘26 | Software Developer  \nLinkedIn: [Your LinkedIn] | Portfolio: [Your Portfolio URL]",
      "Subject: Combining Tech Innovation & Human-Centric Design at Google  \n\nHi Lauren,  \n\nAs someone who bridges technical expertise with talent strategy at Google, I wanted to connect after seeing your work adapting HR practices for complex technical teams across Europe.

image-only output.\\n\\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image empowers users to seamlessly blend multiple images, maintain consistent characters for richer storytelling, perform targeted edits with natural language, and leverage Gemini\\'s extensive world knowledge for image generation and modification. The model is accessible through theGemini APIonGoogle AI Studioand onVertex AIfor enterprise use.\\n\\nFurther expanding creative possibilities, the model now supports 10 different aspect ratios. This allows for effortless content creation across various formats, from cinematic landscapes to vertical social media posts.\\n\\nSupported ratios include:\\n\\n* Landscape: 21:9, 16:9, 4:3, 3:2\\n* Square: 1:1\\n* Portrait: 9:16, 3:4, 2:3\\n* Flexible: 5:4, 4:5\\n\\n## What people are building\\n\\nCartwheelis harnessing AI to move beyond the \"slot machine user experience\" of many image generators, giving artists direct control to bring their creative vision to life. After months of building their \"Pose Mode\" feature and finding that other models failed to deliver, the team found a solution in the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. By combining Cartwheel\\'s 3D posing tool with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, they have created a powerful new image creation system that delivers unparalleled character control and consistency.\\n\\n“Other models couldn\\'t render characters from arbitrary camera angles or maintain faithfulness to a pose without sacrificing \"world knowledge\". The new Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model was the first that could provide both.” -Andrew Carr, Co-founder of Cartwheel\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nVolley, the creators of the AI powered dungeon crawler Wit\\'s End, use Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to generate and edit visuals in-session—character portraits, dynamic scene stills, multi-character compositions, and quick iterative edits from chat or voice.\\n\\n“The model demonstrates state-of-the-art rule-following to aesthetic guidance while retaining latency under <10s, unlocking many live applications, for example, letting players select styles and refine outputs in multi-turn loops.” - James Wilsterman, CTO at Volley\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nIt\\'s been incredible to see the community\\'s creativity in action during recent hackathons withKaggleandCerebral Valley, which saw hundreds of submissions showcasing the model\\'s capabilities in diverse fields like STEM education, marketing collateral, and real-time augmented reality.\\n\\n## Start building\\n\\nDevelopers can begin building with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image today.

This is the first Gemini Robotics model to be made broadly available. It acts as a high-level reasoning model for a robot.\\n\\nThis model specializes in capabilities critical for robotics, including visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. It can also natively call tools, likeGoogle Searchto find information, and can call a vision-language-action model (VLA) or any other third-party user-defined functions to execute the task.\\n\\nYou can get started building with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 today in preview viaGoogle AI Studioand the Gemini API.\\n\\nThis model is designed for tasks that are notoriously challenging for robots. Imagine asking a robot, “Can you sort these objects into the correct compost, recycling and trash bins?\" To complete this task, the robot needs to look up the local recycling guidelines on the internet, understand the objects in front of it and figure out how to sort them based on local rules, then do all the steps to complete putting them away. Most daily tasks, like this one, take contextual information and multiple steps to complete.\\n\\nGemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is the first thinking model optimized for this kind of embodied reasoning.

This is the first Gemini Robotics model to be made broadly available. It acts as a high-level reasoning model for a robot.\\n\\nThis model specializes in capabilities critical for robotics, including visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. It can also natively call tools, likeGoogle Searchto find information, and can call a vision-language-action model (VLA) or any other third-party user-defined functions to execute the task.\\n\\nYou can get started building with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 today in preview viaGoogle AI Studioand the Gemini API.\\n\\nThis model is designed for tasks that are notoriously challenging for robots. Imagine asking a robot, “Can you sort these objects into the correct compost, recycling and trash bins?\" To complete this task, the robot needs to look up the local recycling guidelines on the internet, understand the objects in front of it and figure out how to sort them based on local rules, then do all the steps to complete putting them away. Most daily tasks, like this one, take contextual information and multiple steps to complete.\\n\\nGemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is the first thinking model optimized for this kind of embodied reasoning. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on both academic and internal benchmarks, inspired by real-world use cases from our trusted tester program.', 'title': 'Building the Next Generation of Physical Agents with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5- Google Developers Blog', 'url': 'https://developers.googleblog.com/en/building-the-next-generation-of-physical-agents-with-gemini-robotics-er-15/'}, {'markdown': 'developers.googleblog.com uses cookies from Google to deliver and enhance the quality of its services and to analyze traffic.Learn more.\\n\\n# Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast – new pricing, new configurations and better resolution\\n\\n* Facebook\\n* Twitter\\n* LinkedIn\\n* Mail\\n\\nToday, we’re launching three big Veo updates: support for vertical format outputs (9:16 aspect ratio), 1080p HD output, andnew, lower pricing.We\\'re also makingVeo 3and Veo 3 Fast stable and ready for scaled production use in the Gemini API.\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\n## More Veo, for less\\n\\nEffective today, we’re making it more affordable to generate high-quality videos with Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast with price reductions across the board.\\n\\n* Veo 3:Now $0.40 / second; was $0.75 / second\\n\\n* Veo 3 Fast:Now $0.15 / second; was $0.40 / second\\n\\n## Vertical video and 1080p support\\n\\nWith Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast, you can now set the aspect ratio to 9:16 so that you can generate vertical format videos that are perfect for mobile-first and social use cases.
