now ready for production with new aspect ratios\\n\\n* Facebook\\n* Twitter\\n* LinkedIn\\n* Mail\\n\\nOur state-of-the-art image generation and editing model which has captured the imagination of the world, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image 🍌, is now generally available, ready for production environments, and comes with new features like a wider range of aspect ratios in addition to being able to specify image-only output.\\n\\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image empowers users to seamlessly blend multiple images, maintain consistent characters for richer storytelling, perform targeted edits with natural language, and leverage Gemini\\'s extensive world knowledge for image generation and modification. The model is accessible through theGemini APIonGoogle AI Studioand onVertex AIfor enterprise use.\\n\\nFurther expanding creative possibilities, the model now supports 10 different aspect ratios. This allows for effortless content creation across various formats, from cinematic landscapes to vertical social media posts.\\n\\nSupported ratios include:\\n\\n* Landscape: 21:9, 16:9, 4:3, 3:2\\n* Square: 1:1\\n* Portrait: 9:16, 3:4, 2:3\\n* Flexible: 5:4, 4:5\\n\\n## What people are building\\n\\nCartwheelis harnessing AI to move beyond the \"slot machine user experience\" of many image generators, giving artists direct control to bring their creative vision to life. After months of building their \"Pose Mode\" feature and finding that other models failed to deliver, the team found a solution in the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. By combining Cartwheel\\'s 3D posing tool with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, they have created a powerful new image creation system that delivers unparalleled character control and consistency.\\n\\n“Other models couldn\\'t render characters from arbitrary camera angles or maintain faithfulness to a pose without sacrificing \"world knowledge\". The new Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model was the first that could provide both.” -Andrew Carr, Co-founder of Cartwheel\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nVolley, the creators of the AI powered dungeon crawler Wit\\'s End, use Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to generate and edit visuals in-session—character portraits, dynamic scene stills, multi-character compositions, and quick iterative edits from chat or voice.\\n\\n“The model demonstrates state-of-the-art rule-following to aesthetic guidance while retaining latency under <10s, unlocking many live applications, for example, letting players select styles and refine outputs in multi-turn loops.” - James Wilsterman, CTO at Volley\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nIt\\'s been incredible to see the community\\'s creativity in action during recent hackathons withKaggleandCerebral Valley, which saw hundreds of submissions showcasing the model\\'s capabilities in diverse fields like STEM education, marketing collateral, and real-time augmented reality.\\n\\n## Start building\\n\\nDevelopers can begin building with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image today. Check out thedeveloper docsandcookbookfor guidance on the new features, including the expanded aspect ratios and the ability to specify image-only output. The model is available via theGemini APIand for testing inGoogle AI Studio.\\n\\nBuilding with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is easy with Google AI Studio’s “build mode.” Instantly create and remix custom AI-powered apps from a single prompt, like \"Build me an image editing app with filters.\" When you\\'re ready, deploy your creation directly from AI Studio or save the code to GitHub—all for free. Try out and remix some of our example apps:\\n\\n* Bananimate: Create animated GIFs with Nano Banana from your images and prompts.\\n* Enhance: Infinitely zoom into any photography with our creative upscaler. See if you can find the easter-egg (hint: 🍌)\\n* Fit check: Upload a photo of yourself and an outfit to see how it looks on you. A virtual fitting room powered by Nano Banana.\\n\\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image is priced at $0.039 per image, with a rate of $30.00 per 1 million output tokens. Pricing for other input and output modalities aligns with the standard Gemini 2.5 Flashpricing.\\n\\nHere is a sample code to get you started:\\n\\n```\\nfromgoogleimportgenaifromgoogle.genaiimporttypesfromPILimportImage\\n\\nclient=genai.Client()prompt=\"Create a photograph of the subject in this image as if they were living in the 1980s.

This is the first Gemini Robotics model to be made broadly available. It acts as a high-level reasoning model for a robot.\\n\\nThis model specializes in capabilities critical for robotics, including visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. It can also natively call tools, likeGoogle Searchto find information, and can call a vision-language-action model (VLA) or any other third-party user-defined functions to execute the task.\\n\\nYou can get started building with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 today in preview viaGoogle AI Studioand the Gemini API.\\n\\nThis model is designed for tasks that are notoriously challenging for robots. Imagine asking a robot, “Can you sort these objects into the correct compost, recycling and trash bins?\" To complete this task, the robot needs to look up the local recycling guidelines on the internet, understand the objects in front of it and figure out how to sort them based on local rules, then do all the steps to complete putting them away. Most daily tasks, like this one, take contextual information and multiple steps to complete.\\n\\nGemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is the first thinking model optimized for this kind of embodied reasoning.

now ready for production with new aspect ratios\\n\\n* Facebook\\n* Twitter\\n* LinkedIn\\n* Mail\\n\\nOur state-of-the-art image generation and editing model which has captured the imagination of the world, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image 🍌, is now generally available, ready for production environments, and comes with new features like a wider range of aspect ratios in addition to being able to specify image-only output.\\n\\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image empowers users to seamlessly blend multiple images, maintain consistent characters for richer storytelling, perform targeted edits with natural language, and leverage Gemini\\'s extensive world knowledge for image generation and modification. The model is accessible through theGemini APIonGoogle AI Studioand onVertex AIfor enterprise use.\\n\\nFurther expanding creative possibilities, the model now supports 10 different aspect ratios. This allows for effortless content creation across various formats, from cinematic landscapes to vertical social media posts.\\n\\nSupported ratios include:\\n\\n* Landscape: 21:9, 16:9, 4:3, 3:2\\n* Square: 1:1\\n* Portrait: 9:16, 3:4, 2:3\\n* Flexible: 5:4, 4:5\\n\\n## What people are building\\n\\nCartwheelis harnessing AI to move beyond the \"slot machine user experience\" of many image generators, giving artists direct control to bring their creative vision to life. After months of building their \"Pose Mode\" feature and finding that other models failed to deliver, the team found a solution in the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. By combining Cartwheel\\'s 3D posing tool with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, they have created a powerful new image creation system that delivers unparalleled character control and consistency.\\n\\n“Other models couldn\\'t render characters from arbitrary camera angles or maintain faithfulness to a pose without sacrificing \"world knowledge\". The new Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model was the first that could provide both.” -Andrew Carr, Co-founder of Cartwheel\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nVolley, the creators of the AI powered dungeon crawler Wit\\'s End, use Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to generate and edit visuals in-session—character portraits, dynamic scene stills, multi-character compositions, and quick iterative edits from chat or voice.\\n\\n“The model demonstrates state-of-the-art rule-following to aesthetic guidance while retaining latency under <10s, unlocking many live applications, for example, letting players select styles and refine outputs in multi-turn loops.” - James Wilsterman, CTO at Volley\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nIt\\'s been incredible to see the community\\'s creativity in action during recent hackathons withKaggleandCerebral Valley, which saw hundreds of submissions showcasing the model\\'s capabilities in diverse fields like STEM education, marketing collateral, and real-time augmented reality.\\n\\n## Start building\\n\\nDevelopers can begin building with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image today. Check out thedeveloper docsandcookbookfor guidance on the new features, including the expanded aspect ratios and the ability to specify image-only output. The model is available via theGemini APIand for testing inGoogle AI Studio.\\n\\nBuilding with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is easy with Google AI Studio’s “build mode.” Instantly create and remix custom AI-powered apps from a single prompt, like \"Build me an image editing app with filters.\" When you\\'re ready, deploy your creation directly from AI Studio or save the code to GitHub—all for free. Try out and remix some of our example apps:\\n\\n* Bananimate: Create animated GIFs with Nano Banana from your images and prompts.\\n* Enhance: Infinitely zoom into any photography with our creative upscaler. See if you can find the easter-egg (hint: 🍌)\\n* Fit check: Upload a photo of yourself and an outfit to see how it looks on you. A virtual fitting room powered by Nano Banana.\\n\\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image is priced at $0.039 per image, with a rate of $30.00 per 1 million output tokens. Pricing for other input and output modalities aligns with the standard Gemini 2.5 Flashpricing.\\n\\nHere is a sample code to get you started:\\n\\n```\\nfromgoogleimportgenaifromgoogle.genaiimporttypesfromPILimportImage\\n\\nclient=genai.Client()prompt=\"Create a photograph of the subject in this image as if they were living in the 1980s.

This is the first Gemini Robotics model to be made broadly available. It acts as a high-level reasoning model for a robot.\\n\\nThis model specializes in capabilities critical for robotics, including visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. It can also natively call tools, likeGoogle Searchto find information, and can call a vision-language-action model (VLA) or any other third-party user-defined functions to execute the task.\\n\\nYou can get started building with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 today in preview viaGoogle AI Studioand the Gemini API.\\n\\nThis model is designed for tasks that are notoriously challenging for robots. Imagine asking a robot, “Can you sort these objects into the correct compost, recycling and trash bins?\" To complete this task, the robot needs to look up the local recycling guidelines on the internet, understand the objects in front of it and figure out how to sort them based on local rules, then do all the steps to complete putting them away. Most daily tasks, like this one, take contextual information and multiple steps to complete.\\n\\nGemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is the first thinking model optimized for this kind of embodied reasoning.

      "Subject: Bridging Game Design & AI Innovation at Google – Let’s Connect  \n\nHi Lauren,  \n\nAs a fellow advocate for blending creativity and technology (your work in game theory and design aligns with my passion for video game development), I wanted to reach out regarding opportunities at Google. Your expertise in talent strategy for tech teams—paired with Google’s breakthroughs like Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 and Veo 3’s 9:16 video capabilities—resonates deeply with my work at Dotdotdot, where I’ve engineered React.js-powered web apps and led UI/UX design for immersive digital experiences.  \n\nI’ve been inspired by Google’s push to enhance creative tools like Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, particularly how Cartwheel leverages it for character consistency—a challenge I’ve tackled firsthand in 3D modeling and game design projects. With expertise in full-stack development (Python, JavaScript) and a focus on user-centric design, I’m eager to contribute to initiatives that empower creators through cutting-edge AI.  \n\nGiven your background in fostering tech talent across Europe (I’m based in Milan, completing my Computer Engineering degree at Politecnico Di Milano), I’d love to discuss how my hybrid technical and creative skill set could align with Google’s innovation roadmap. Would you be open to a brief virtual coffee chat this week?  \n\nBest regards,  \nAlessio Antonucci",
      "Subject: Bridging European Tech Talent & Google’s Creative AI Vision  \n\nHi Lauren,  \n\nAs a Computer Engineering student at Politecnico di Milano with hands-on software development experience at Dotdotdot (Milan’s award-winning design/tech studio), I’ve been closely following Google’s breakthroughs in creative AI tools like Gemini 2.5 Flash Image – particularly how teams are applying its aspect ratio flexibility and character consistency to redefine interactive storytelling.  \n\nYour unique background bridging mathematics, organizational psychology, and technical talent development at Google/Adobe caught my attention. With my combined foundation in full-stack development (React, Python, C#) and human-centered design projects (including interactive installations and game prototypes), I believe I could contribute meaningfully to teams shaping tools that democratize creative expression – especially given Google’s expanded focus on multimodal AI applications as highlighted in recent developer blog updates.  \n\nWould you have 15 minutes to discuss how emerging European tech talent might align with Google’s innovation pipeline in London or Milan? I’m particularly curious about how you see cross-functional teams balancing rapid AI advancements with thoughtful UX – a challenge I navigated firsthand while optimizing AR interfaces for accessibility at Dotdotdot.  \n\nLooking forward to your insights,  \nAlessio Antonucci  \nPolitecnico di Milano ‘26 | Software Developer  \nLinkedIn: [Your LinkedIn] | Portfolio: [Your Portfolio URL]",
      "Subject: Combining Tech Innovation & Human-Centric Design at Google  \n\nHi Lauren,  \n\nAs someone who bridges technical expertise with talent strategy at Google, I wanted to connect after seeing your work adapting HR practices for complex technical teams across Europe.

image-only output.\\n\\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image empowers users to seamlessly blend multiple images, maintain consistent characters for richer storytelling, perform targeted edits with natural language, and leverage Gemini\\'s extensive world knowledge for image generation and modification. The model is accessible through theGemini APIonGoogle AI Studioand onVertex AIfor enterprise use.\\n\\nFurther expanding creative possibilities, the model now supports 10 different aspect ratios. This allows for effortless content creation across various formats, from cinematic landscapes to vertical social media posts.\\n\\nSupported ratios include:\\n\\n* Landscape: 21:9, 16:9, 4:3, 3:2\\n* Square: 1:1\\n* Portrait: 9:16, 3:4, 2:3\\n* Flexible: 5:4, 4:5\\n\\n## What people are building\\n\\nCartwheelis harnessing AI to move beyond the \"slot machine user experience\" of many image generators, giving artists direct control to bring their creative vision to life. After months of building their \"Pose Mode\" feature and finding that other models failed to deliver, the team found a solution in the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. By combining Cartwheel\\'s 3D posing tool with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, they have created a powerful new image creation system that delivers unparalleled character control and consistency.\\n\\n“Other models couldn\\'t render characters from arbitrary camera angles or maintain faithfulness to a pose without sacrificing \"world knowledge\". The new Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model was the first that could provide both.” -Andrew Carr, Co-founder of Cartwheel\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nVolley, the creators of the AI powered dungeon crawler Wit\\'s End, use Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to generate and edit visuals in-session—character portraits, dynamic scene stills, multi-character compositions, and quick iterative edits from chat or voice.\\n\\n“The model demonstrates state-of-the-art rule-following to aesthetic guidance while retaining latency under <10s, unlocking many live applications, for example, letting players select styles and refine outputs in multi-turn loops.” - James Wilsterman, CTO at Volley\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\nIt\\'s been incredible to see the community\\'s creativity in action during recent hackathons withKaggleandCerebral Valley, which saw hundreds of submissions showcasing the model\\'s capabilities in diverse fields like STEM education, marketing collateral, and real-time augmented reality.\\n\\n## Start building\\n\\nDevelopers can begin building with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image today.

This is the first Gemini Robotics model to be made broadly available. It acts as a high-level reasoning model for a robot.\\n\\nThis model specializes in capabilities critical for robotics, including visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. It can also natively call tools, likeGoogle Searchto find information, and can call a vision-language-action model (VLA) or any other third-party user-defined functions to execute the task.\\n\\nYou can get started building with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 today in preview viaGoogle AI Studioand the Gemini API.\\n\\nThis model is designed for tasks that are notoriously challenging for robots. Imagine asking a robot, “Can you sort these objects into the correct compost, recycling and trash bins?\" To complete this task, the robot needs to look up the local recycling guidelines on the internet, understand the objects in front of it and figure out how to sort them based on local rules, then do all the steps to complete putting them away. Most daily tasks, like this one, take contextual information and multiple steps to complete.\\n\\nGemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is the first thinking model optimized for this kind of embodied reasoning.

This is the first Gemini Robotics model to be made broadly available. It acts as a high-level reasoning model for a robot.\\n\\nThis model specializes in capabilities critical for robotics, including visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. It can also natively call tools, likeGoogle Searchto find information, and can call a vision-language-action model (VLA) or any other third-party user-defined functions to execute the task.\\n\\nYou can get started building with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 today in preview viaGoogle AI Studioand the Gemini API.\\n\\nThis model is designed for tasks that are notoriously challenging for robots. Imagine asking a robot, “Can you sort these objects into the correct compost, recycling and trash bins?\" To complete this task, the robot needs to look up the local recycling guidelines on the internet, understand the objects in front of it and figure out how to sort them based on local rules, then do all the steps to complete putting them away. Most daily tasks, like this one, take contextual information and multiple steps to complete.\\n\\nGemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is the first thinking model optimized for this kind of embodied reasoning. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on both academic and internal benchmarks, inspired by real-world use cases from our trusted tester program.', 'title': 'Building the Next Generation of Physical Agents with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5- Google Developers Blog', 'url': 'https://developers.googleblog.com/en/building-the-next-generation-of-physical-agents-with-gemini-robotics-er-15/'}, {'markdown': 'developers.googleblog.com uses cookies from Google to deliver and enhance the quality of its services and to analyze traffic.Learn more.\\n\\n# Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast – new pricing, new configurations and better resolution\\n\\n* Facebook\\n* Twitter\\n* LinkedIn\\n* Mail\\n\\nToday, we’re launching three big Veo updates: support for vertical format outputs (9:16 aspect ratio), 1080p HD output, andnew, lower pricing.We\\'re also makingVeo 3and Veo 3 Fast stable and ready for scaled production use in the Gemini API.\\n\\nLink to Youtube Video(visible only when JS is disabled)\\n\\n## More Veo, for less\\n\\nEffective today, we’re making it more affordable to generate high-quality videos with Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast with price reductions across the board.\\n\\n* Veo 3:Now $0.40 / second; was $0.75 / second\\n\\n* Veo 3 Fast:Now $0.15 / second; was $0.40 / second\\n\\n## Vertical video and 1080p support\\n\\nWith Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast, you can now set the aspect ratio to 9:16 so that you can generate vertical format videos that are perfect for mobile-first and social use cases.

(OR CREATE IT)**: Analyze the recruiter's background deeply to identify shared elements.\n   - Primary targets: Same university, previous companies, mutual connections, shared professional groups.\n   - **Fallback strategy**: If no direct common ground exists, identify a specific, non-generic aspect of their career you genuinely admire (e.g., an article they wrote, a talk they gave, their transition from one industry to another).\n\n2. **LEAD WITH A STRATEGIC SUBJECT LINE**: Create a subject line that is both professional and intriguing, ideally hinting at the common ground or a key value proposition. *Example: \"Fellow [University Name] Alum & Data Scientist\" or \"Question about your work at [Previous Company]\"*.\n\n3. **LEAD WITH CONNECTION**: Start the email's first sentence by mentioning the most compelling commonality naturally. Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment. **If the SCENARIO is \"Specific Role\", subtly mention your interest in that area.**\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

Generative recommenders (GRs) represent a new paradigm in the field of recommendation systems (e.g.HSTU,OneRec). These models draw inspiration from recent advancements in transformer architectures used for language and vision tasks. They approach the recommendation problem, including both ranking and retrieval, as a sequential transduction task. This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens. The reward model uses an open-sourced HSTU architecture in the convenience of reproducing this study. We adopt the standard RLHF approach of training a reward model using offline, human-collected feedback. We start by creating a proxy reward, scored on a scale from 1 to 5 in the convenience of understanding. This reward model is co-trained as a shallow reward head on top of the generative recommender. It predicts the reward for the most recently selected title based on a user’s interaction history. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare the model’s performance against two simple baselines: (1) predicting the next reward as the average reward the user has given in their past interactions, and (2) predicting it as the average reward that all users have assigned to that particular title in previous interactions.\\n\\nTable 1: Reward model performance metrics\\n\\nWe observe that the model’s predictions do not significantly outperform the simple baselines. This result is intuitive, as a user’s historical interactions typically cover only a small subset of titles, making it difficult to accurately predict their responses to the vast number of unexplored titles in the catalogue. We expect this to be a potential issue for any large recommendation systems where the ratio between explored and unexplored titles is very small.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\n3. Lack of Logged Policy\\n\\nIn recommendation systems, the policy that generated the logged data is typically unknown and cannot be directly estimated. Offline reinforcement learning methods often rely on Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to debias such data by reweighting interactions according to the logging policy’s action probabilities. However, estimating the logging policy accurately is challenging and prone to error, which can introduce additional biases, and IPS itself is known to suffer from high variance. Consequently, offline RL approaches that depend on IPS are ill-suited for our setting.\\n\\n## Advantage Weighted Supervised Fine Tuning\\n\\nGiven the three challenges outlined above, we propose a new algorithm Advantage-Weighted SFT (A-SFT). It leverages a combination of supervised fine-tuning and advantage reweighting from reinforcement learning. The key observation is as follows. Despite the reward estimation for each individual event having a high uncertainty, we find the estimations of rewards contain directional signals between high-reward and low-reward events. These signals could help better align the model during post-training.\\n\\nA central factor in this study is the generalization ability of the reward model. Better generalization enables more accurate predictions of user preferences for unseen titles, thereby making exploration more effective. For reward models with moderate to high generalization power, both online RL methods such as PPO and offline RL methods such as CQL can perform effectively. However, in our setting, reward model generalization is worse than the language counterparts’, which makes these algorithms less appropriate. In addition, the use of techniques like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) introduces a heightened risk of high-variance estimates, prompting us to exclude algorithms such as off-policy REINFORCE.\\n\\nOur proposed method A-SFT does not rely on IPS. With no need of prior knowledge of the logging policy, it can be generally applied to cases where observation of the environments are limited or biased. This is particularly useful to the recommendation setting due to the user feedback loop and distribution shifts with time. Without knowing the logging policy, A-SFT still provides means to control the policy deviation between the current policy and logging policy by tuning the parameter. This design provides essential means to control the learnt bias from uncertain reward models. We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1. Rejection Sampling Direct Preference Optimization / Identity Preference Optimization (RS DPO/IPO): this is a variant of DPO/IPO where, for each user history x, \\u200bwe generate contrasting response pairs by training an ensemble of reward models to estimate confidence intervals for the reward of multiple potential responses y. If the lower bound of the reward confidence interval for one response\\u200b is less than the upper bound for another response, then this pair is used to train DPO/IPO.\\n1. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL): This is a standard offline algorithm that learns a conservative Q function, penalizing overestimation of Q-values, particularly in regions of the state-action space with little or no reward data.\\n1. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): This is a standard RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) algorithm that uses reward models as an online environment. PPO learns an advantage function and optimizes the policy to maximize expected reward while maintaining proximity to the initial policy.\\n\\nWe sampled a separate test set of O(Millions) users. This test set is collected on a future date after the training.\\n\\n## Offline Evaluation Results\\n\\nWe evaluate our algorithm on a dataset of high-reward user trajectories. For sake of simplicity, we consider a trajectory to have a high reward if the accumulated reward is higher than the median of the population. We present the following metrics for the held out test dataset:\\n\\n1. NDCG@k: This measures the ranking quality of the recommended items up to position k. It accounts for the position of relevant items in the recommendation list, assigning higher scores when relevant items appear higher in the ranking. The gain is discounted logarithmically at lower ranks, and the result is normalized by the ideal ranking (i.e., the best possible ordering of items).\\n1. HR@k: This measures the proportion of test cases in which the ground-truth chosen item y appears in the top k recommendations. It is a binary metric per test case (hit or miss) and is averaged over all test cases.\\n1. MRR: MRR evaluates the ranking quality by measuring the reciprocal of the rank at which the chosen item appears in the recommendation list. The metric is averaged across all test cases.\\n1. Reward Model as A Judge: We use the reward model to evaluate the policy for future user events. We propose to use an ensemble of reward models for the evaluation to increase confidence. The result is based on the discounted reward generated for a few steps. The standard deviation is less than 4%.\\n\\nWe measure the percentage improvement in each metric compared to the baseline, Reward Weighted Behavior Cloning(BC). We notice that advantage weighted SFT shows the largest improvement in metrics, outweighing BC as well as reward model dependent algorithms like CQL, PPO, DPO and IPO.\\n\\nOur experiments show that advantage weighted SFT is a simple but promising approach for post-training generative recommenders as it deals with the issue of poor reward model generalizations and lack of IPS. More specifically, we find PPO, IPO and DPO achieve a good reward score, but also causes the overfitting from the reward model. Conservative Q-Learning achieves more robust improvements but does not fully capture the potential signals in the reward modeling.

Generative recommenders (GRs) represent a new paradigm in the field of recommendation systems (e.g.HSTU,OneRec). These models draw inspiration from recent advancements in transformer architectures used for language and vision tasks. They approach the recommendation problem, including both ranking and retrieval, as a sequential transduction task. This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models.

Check outpart 1andpart 2to learn more.\\n\\nPicture this: It’s seconds before the biggest fight night in Netflix history. Sixty-five million fans are waiting, devices in hand, hearts pounding. The countdown hits zero. What does it take to get everyone to the action on time, every time? At Netflix, we’re used to on-demand viewing where everyone chooses their own moment. But with live events, millions are eager to join in at once. Our job: make sure our members never miss a beat.\\n\\nWhen Live events break streaming records¹²³, our infrastructure faces the ultimate stress test. Here’s how we engineered a discovery experience for a global audience excited to see a knockout.\\n\\n## Why are Live Events Different?\\n\\nUnlike Video on Demand (VOD), members want to catch live events as they happen. There’s something uniquely exciting about being part of the moment. That means we only have a brief window to recommend a Live event at just the right time. Too early, excitement fades; too late, the moment is missed. Every second counts.\\n\\nTo capture that excitement, we enhanced our recommendation delivery systems to serve real-time suggestions, providing members richer and more compelling signals to hit play in the moment when it matters most. The challenge? Sending dynamic, timely updates concurrently to over a hundred million devices worldwide without creating athundering herd effectthat would overwhelm our cloud services. Simply scaling up linearly isn’t efficient and reliable. For popular events, it could also divert resources from other critical services. We needed a smarter and more scalable solution than just adding more resources.\\n\\n## Orchestrating the moment: Real-time Recommendations\\n\\nWith millions of devices online and live event schedules that can shift in real time, the challenge was to keep everyone perfectly in sync. We set out to solve this by building a system that doesn’t just react, but adapts by dynamically updating recommendations as the event unfolds. We identified the need to balance three constraints:\\n\\n* Time: the duration required to coordinate an update.\\n* Request throughput:the capacity of our cloud services to handle requests.\\n* Compute cardinality: the variety of requests necessary to serve a unique update.\\n\\nWe solved this constraint optimization problem by splitting the real-time recommendations into two phases:prefetchingandreal-time broadcasting. First, we prefetch the necessary data ahead of time, distributing the load over a longer period to avoid traffic spikes. When the Live event starts or ends, we broadcast a low cardinality message to all connected devices, prompting them to use the prefetched data locally. The timing of the broadcast also adapts when event times shift to preserve accuracy with the production of the Live event. By combining these two phases, we’re able to keep our members’ devices in sync and solve the thundering herd problem. To maximize device reach, especially for those with unstable networks, we use “at least once” broadcasts to ensure every device gets the latest updates and can catch up on any previously missed broadcasts as soon as they’re back online.\\n\\nThe first phase optimizesrequest throughputandcompute cardinalityby prefetching materialized recommendations, displayed title metadata, and artwork for a Live event. As members naturally browse their devices before the event, this data is prepopulated and stored locally in device cache, awaiting the notification trigger to serve the recommendations instantaneously. By distributing these requests naturally over time ahead of the event, we can eliminate any related traffic spikes and avoid the need for large-scale, real-time system scaling.\\n\\nThe second phase optimizesrequest throughputandtimeto updatedevices by broadcasting a low-cardinality, real-time message to all connected devices at critical moments in a Live event’s lifecycle. Each broadcast payload includes astate keyand atimestamp. The state key indicates the current stage of the Live event, allowing devices to use their pre-fetched data to update cached responses locally without additional server requests. The timestamp ensures that if a device misses a broadcast due to network issues, it can catch up by replaying missed updates upon reconnecting. This mechanism guarantees devices receive updates at least once, significantly increasing delivery reliability even on unstable networks.\\n\\n> Moment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\nMoment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\n## Under the Hood: How It Works\\n\\nWith the big picture in mind, let’s examine how these pieces interact in practice.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\nIn the diagram below, the Message Producer microservice centralizes all of the business logic. It continuously monitors live events for setup and timing changes. When it detects an update, it schedules broadcasts to be sent at precisely the right moment. The Message Producer also standardizes communication by providing a concise GraphQL schema for both device queries and broadcast payloads.\\n\\nRather than sending broadcasts directly to devices via WebSocket, the Message Producer hands them off to the Message Router. The Message Router is part of a robust two-tier pub/sub architecture built on proven technologies likePushy(our WebSocket proxy), Apache Kafka, andNetflix’s KV key-value store. The Message Router tracks subscriptions at the Pushy node granularity, while Pushy nodes map the subscriptions to individual connections, creating a low-latency fanout that minimizes compute and bandwidth requirements.\\n\\nDevices interface with our GraphQLDomain Graph Service (DGS). These schemas offer multiple query interfaces for prefetching, allowing devices to tailor their requests to the specific experience being presented. Each response adheres to a consistent API that resolves to a map of stage keys, enabling fast lookups and keeping business logic off the device. Our broadcast schema specifies WebSocket connection parameters, the current event stage, and the timestamp of the last broadcast message. When a device receives a broadcast, it injects the payload directly into its cache, triggering an immediate update and re-render of the interface.\\n\\n## Balancing the Moment: Throughput Management\\n\\nIn addition to building the new technology to support real-time recommendations, we also evaluated our existing systems for potential traffic hotspots. Using high-watermark traffic projections for live events, we generated synthetic traffic to simulate game-day scenarios and observed how our online services handled these bursts. Through this process, several common patterns emerged:\\n\\nBreaking the Cache Synchrony\\n\\nOur game-day simulations revealed that while our approach mitigated the immediate thundering herd risks driven by member traffic during the events, live events introduced unexpected mini thundering herds in our systems hours before and after the actual events. The surge of members joining just in time for these events led to concentrated cache expirations and recomputations, which created traffic spikes well outside the event window that we did not anticipate. This was not a problem for VOD content because the member traffic patterns are a lot smoother. We found that fixed TTLs caused cache expirations and refresh-traffic spikes to happen all at once. To address this, we added jitter to server and client cache expirations to spread out refreshes and smooth out traffic spikes.\\n\\nAdaptive Traffic Prioritization\\n\\nWhile our services already leverage traffic prioritization and partitioning based on factors such as request type and device type, live events introduced a distinct challenge. These events generated brief traffic bursts that were intensely spiky and placed significant strain on our systems. Through simulations, we recognized the need for an additional event-driven layer of traffic management.\\n\\nTo tackle this, we improved our traffic sharding strategies by using event-based signals. This enabled us to route live event traffic to dedicated clusters with more aggressive scaling policies. We also added a dynamic traffic prioritization ruleset that activates whenever we see high requests per second (RPS) to ensure our systems can handle the surge smoothly. During these peaks, we aggressively deprioritize non-critical server-driven updates so that our systems can devote resources to the most time-sensitive computations. This approach ensures smooth performance and reliability when demand is at its highest.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nWhen we set out to build a seamlessly scalable scheduled viewing experience, our goal was to create a dynamic and richer member experience for live content. Popular live events like the Crawford v. Canelo fight and the NFL Christmas games truly put our systems to the test. Along the way, we also uncovered valuable learnings that continue to shape our work. Our attempts to deprioritize traffic to other non-critical services caused unexpected call patterns and spikes in traffic elsewhere. Similarly, in hindsight, we also learned that the high traffic volume from popular events caused excessive non-essential logging and was putting unnecessary pressure on our ingestion pipelines.\\n\\nNone of this work would have been possible without our stunning colleagues at Netflix who collaborated across multiple functions to architect, build, and test these approaches, ensuring members can easily access events at the right moment: UI Engineering, Cloud Gateway, Data Science & Engineering, Search and Discovery, Evidence Engineering, Member Experience Foundations, Content Promotion and Distribution, Operations and Reliability, Device Playback, Experience and Design and Product Management.\\n\\nAs Netflix’s content offering expands to include new formats like live titles, free-to-air linear content, and games, we’re excited to build on what we’ve accomplished and look ahead to even more possibilities. Our roadmap includes extending the capabilities we developed for scheduled live viewing to these emerging formats. We’re also focused on enhancing our engineering tooling for greater visibility into operations, message delivery, and error handling to help us continue to deliver the best possible experience for our members.\\n\\n## Join Us for What’s Next\\n\\nWe’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible as we bring new live experiences to members around the world.

Avoid clichés like \"I hope this email finds you well.\"\n\n4. **CREATE A HYPOTHETICAL BRIDGE**: Use the articles/news to demonstrate deep interest. **Don't just mention the news; connect it to a potential challenge or opportunity for the company.** *Example: \"I read about your recent launch of Product X. I imagine that optimizing user engagement is a key priority. In my previous role at Y, I increased engagement by 20% by...\"* This shows proactive problem-solving.\n\n5. **FRAME YOURSELF AS A SOLUTION**: Connect your most relevant experience directly to the hypothesis you just created or to the recruiter's specific focus area. Show how you can deliver value to *their* team or *their* specific hiring goals.\n\n6. **BE SPECIFIC**: Avoid generic phrases. Use concrete examples and specific metrics from your background and your research on the company and recruiter.\n\n7. **TONE**: Professional yet warm and human. Write like you're reaching out to a potential peer, not begging for attention.\n\n8. **LENGTH**: 150-250 words maximum. Respect their time.\n\n9. **LOW-FRICTION CALL TO ACTION**: End with a clear, confident request for a **brief, 15-minute conversation** to explore potential alignment.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with subject, body, and key_points fields\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating the email, create a \"key_points\" array with 3 items that explains why this email is perfectly tailored for the candidate's goal. Each key point must:\n- Be maximum 80 characters long.\n- Highlight a specific strength of the email (commonality, hypothetical bridge, etc.).\n- Be an actionable insight that shows strategic thinking.\n- Focus on WHY this approach will resonate with the recruiter, **touching on its psychological impact** (e.g., \"Builds rapport\", \"Shows proactivity\").\n\nGenerate ONLY the JSON output with no additional commentary.\n"

Generative recommenders (GRs) represent a new paradigm in the field of recommendation systems (e.g.HSTU,OneRec). These models draw inspiration from recent advancements in transformer architectures used for language and vision tasks. They approach the recommendation problem, including both ranking and retrieval, as a sequential transduction task. This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens. The reward model uses an open-sourced HSTU architecture in the convenience of reproducing this study. We adopt the standard RLHF approach of training a reward model using offline, human-collected feedback. We start by creating a proxy reward, scored on a scale from 1 to 5 in the convenience of understanding. This reward model is co-trained as a shallow reward head on top of the generative recommender. It predicts the reward for the most recently selected title based on a user’s interaction history. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare the model’s performance against two simple baselines: (1) predicting the next reward as the average reward the user has given in their past interactions, and (2) predicting it as the average reward that all users have assigned to that particular title in previous interactions.\\n\\nTable 1: Reward model performance metrics\\n\\nWe observe that the model’s predictions do not significantly outperform the simple baselines. This result is intuitive, as a user’s historical interactions typically cover only a small subset of titles, making it difficult to accurately predict their responses to the vast number of unexplored titles in the catalogue. We expect this to be a potential issue for any large recommendation systems where the ratio between explored and unexplored titles is very small.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\n3. Lack of Logged Policy\\n\\nIn recommendation systems, the policy that generated the logged data is typically unknown and cannot be directly estimated. Offline reinforcement learning methods often rely on Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to debias such data by reweighting interactions according to the logging policy’s action probabilities. However, estimating the logging policy accurately is challenging and prone to error, which can introduce additional biases, and IPS itself is known to suffer from high variance. Consequently, offline RL approaches that depend on IPS are ill-suited for our setting.\\n\\n## Advantage Weighted Supervised Fine Tuning\\n\\nGiven the three challenges outlined above, we propose a new algorithm Advantage-Weighted SFT (A-SFT). It leverages a combination of supervised fine-tuning and advantage reweighting from reinforcement learning. The key observation is as follows. Despite the reward estimation for each individual event having a high uncertainty, we find the estimations of rewards contain directional signals between high-reward and low-reward events. These signals could help better align the model during post-training.\\n\\nA central factor in this study is the generalization ability of the reward model. Better generalization enables more accurate predictions of user preferences for unseen titles, thereby making exploration more effective. For reward models with moderate to high generalization power, both online RL methods such as PPO and offline RL methods such as CQL can perform effectively. However, in our setting, reward model generalization is worse than the language counterparts’, which makes these algorithms less appropriate. In addition, the use of techniques like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) introduces a heightened risk of high-variance estimates, prompting us to exclude algorithms such as off-policy REINFORCE.\\n\\nOur proposed method A-SFT does not rely on IPS. With no need of prior knowledge of the logging policy, it can be generally applied to cases where observation of the environments are limited or biased. This is particularly useful to the recommendation setting due to the user feedback loop and distribution shifts with time. Without knowing the logging policy, A-SFT still provides means to control the policy deviation between the current policy and logging policy by tuning the parameter. This design provides essential means to control the learnt bias from uncertain reward models. We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1. Rejection Sampling Direct Preference Optimization / Identity Preference Optimization (RS DPO/IPO): this is a variant of DPO/IPO where, for each user history x, \\u200bwe generate contrasting response pairs by training an ensemble of reward models to estimate confidence intervals for the reward of multiple potential responses y.

Generative recommenders (GRs) represent a new paradigm in the field of recommendation systems (e.g.HSTU,OneRec). These models draw inspiration from recent advancements in transformer architectures used for language and vision tasks. They approach the recommendation problem, including both ranking and retrieval, as a sequential transduction task. This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens. The reward model uses an open-sourced HSTU architecture in the convenience of reproducing this study. We adopt the standard RLHF approach of training a reward model using offline, human-collected feedback. We start by creating a proxy reward, scored on a scale from 1 to 5 in the convenience of understanding. This reward model is co-trained as a shallow reward head on top of the generative recommender. It predicts the reward for the most recently selected title based on a user’s interaction history. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare the model’s performance against two simple baselines: (1) predicting the next reward as the average reward the user has given in their past interactions, and (2) predicting it as the average reward that all users have assigned to that particular title in previous interactions.\\n\\nTable 1: Reward model performance metrics\\n\\nWe observe that the model’s predictions do not significantly outperform the simple baselines. This result is intuitive, as a user’s historical interactions typically cover only a small subset of titles, making it difficult to accurately predict their responses to the vast number of unexplored titles in the catalogue. We expect this to be a potential issue for any large recommendation systems where the ratio between explored and unexplored titles is very small.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\n3. Lack of Logged Policy\\n\\nIn recommendation systems, the policy that generated the logged data is typically unknown and cannot be directly estimated. Offline reinforcement learning methods often rely on Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to debias such data by reweighting interactions according to the logging policy’s action probabilities. However, estimating the logging policy accurately is challenging and prone to error, which can introduce additional biases, and IPS itself is known to suffer from high variance. Consequently, offline RL approaches that depend on IPS are ill-suited for our setting.\\n\\n## Advantage Weighted Supervised Fine Tuning\\n\\nGiven the three challenges outlined above, we propose a new algorithm Advantage-Weighted SFT (A-SFT). It leverages a combination of supervised fine-tuning and advantage reweighting from reinforcement learning. The key observation is as follows. Despite the reward estimation for each individual event having a high uncertainty, we find the estimations of rewards contain directional signals between high-reward and low-reward events. These signals could help better align the model during post-training.\\n\\nA central factor in this study is the generalization ability of the reward model. Better generalization enables more accurate predictions of user preferences for unseen titles, thereby making exploration more effective. For reward models with moderate to high generalization power, both online RL methods such as PPO and offline RL methods such as CQL can perform effectively. However, in our setting, reward model generalization is worse than the language counterparts’, which makes these algorithms less appropriate. In addition, the use of techniques like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) introduces a heightened risk of high-variance estimates, prompting us to exclude algorithms such as off-policy REINFORCE.\\n\\nOur proposed method A-SFT does not rely on IPS. With no need of prior knowledge of the logging policy, it can be generally applied to cases where observation of the environments are limited or biased. This is particularly useful to the recommendation setting due to the user feedback loop and distribution shifts with time. Without knowing the logging policy, A-SFT still provides means to control the policy deviation between the current policy and logging policy by tuning the parameter. This design provides essential means to control the learnt bias from uncertain reward models. We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1.

If the lower bound of the reward confidence interval for one response\\u200b is less than the upper bound for another response, then this pair is used to train DPO/IPO.\\n1.

Check outpart 1andpart 2to learn more.\\n\\nPicture this: It’s seconds before the biggest fight night in Netflix history. Sixty-five million fans are waiting, devices in hand, hearts pounding. The countdown hits zero. What does it take to get everyone to the action on time, every time? At Netflix, we’re used to on-demand viewing where everyone chooses their own moment. But with live events, millions are eager to join in at once. Our job: make sure our members never miss a beat.\\n\\nWhen Live events break streaming records¹²³, our infrastructure faces the ultimate stress test. Here’s how we engineered a discovery experience for a global audience excited to see a knockout.\\n\\n## Why are Live Events Different?\\n\\nUnlike Video on Demand (VOD), members want to catch live events as they happen. There’s something uniquely exciting about being part of the moment. That means we only have a brief window to recommend a Live event at just the right time. Too early, excitement fades; too late, the moment is missed. Every second counts.\\n\\nTo capture that excitement, we enhanced our recommendation delivery systems to serve real-time suggestions, providing members richer and more compelling signals to hit play in the moment when it matters most. The challenge? Sending dynamic, timely updates concurrently to over a hundred million devices worldwide without creating athundering herd effectthat would overwhelm our cloud services. Simply scaling up linearly isn’t efficient and reliable. For popular events, it could also divert resources from other critical services. We needed a smarter and more scalable solution than just adding more resources.\\n\\n## Orchestrating the moment: Real-time Recommendations\\n\\nWith millions of devices online and live event schedules that can shift in real time, the challenge was to keep everyone perfectly in sync. We set out to solve this by building a system that doesn’t just react, but adapts by dynamically updating recommendations as the event unfolds. We identified the need to balance three constraints:\\n\\n* Time: the duration required to coordinate an update.\\n* Request throughput:the capacity of our cloud services to handle requests.\\n* Compute cardinality: the variety of requests necessary to serve a unique update.\\n\\nWe solved this constraint optimization problem by splitting the real-time recommendations into two phases:prefetchingandreal-time broadcasting. First, we prefetch the necessary data ahead of time, distributing the load over a longer period to avoid traffic spikes. When the Live event starts or ends, we broadcast a low cardinality message to all connected devices, prompting them to use the prefetched data locally. The timing of the broadcast also adapts when event times shift to preserve accuracy with the production of the Live event. By combining these two phases, we’re able to keep our members’ devices in sync and solve the thundering herd problem. To maximize device reach, especially for those with unstable networks, we use “at least once” broadcasts to ensure every device gets the latest updates and can catch up on any previously missed broadcasts as soon as they’re back online.\\n\\nThe first phase optimizesrequest throughputandcompute cardinalityby prefetching materialized recommendations, displayed title metadata, and artwork for a Live event. As members naturally browse their devices before the event, this data is prepopulated and stored locally in device cache, awaiting the notification trigger to serve the recommendations instantaneously. By distributing these requests naturally over time ahead of the event, we can eliminate any related traffic spikes and avoid the need for large-scale, real-time system scaling.\\n\\nThe second phase optimizesrequest throughputandtimeto updatedevices by broadcasting a low-cardinality, real-time message to all connected devices at critical moments in a Live event’s lifecycle. Each broadcast payload includes astate keyand atimestamp. The state key indicates the current stage of the Live event, allowing devices to use their pre-fetched data to update cached responses locally without additional server requests. The timestamp ensures that if a device misses a broadcast due to network issues, it can catch up by replaying missed updates upon reconnecting. This mechanism guarantees devices receive updates at least once, significantly increasing delivery reliability even on unstable networks.\\n\\n> Moment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\nMoment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\n## Under the Hood: How It Works\\n\\nWith the big picture in mind, let’s examine how these pieces interact in practice.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\nIn the diagram below, the Message Producer microservice centralizes all of the business logic. It continuously monitors live events for setup and timing changes. When it detects an update, it schedules broadcasts to be sent at precisely the right moment. The Message Producer also standardizes communication by providing a concise GraphQL schema for both device queries and broadcast payloads.\\n\\nRather than sending broadcasts directly to devices via WebSocket, the Message Producer hands them off to the Message Router. The Message Router is part of a robust two-tier pub/sub architecture built on proven technologies likePushy(our WebSocket proxy), Apache Kafka, andNetflix’s KV key-value store. The Message Router tracks subscriptions at the Pushy node granularity, while Pushy nodes map the subscriptions to individual connections, creating a low-latency fanout that minimizes compute and bandwidth requirements.\\n\\nDevices interface with our GraphQLDomain Graph Service (DGS). These schemas offer multiple query interfaces for prefetching, allowing devices to tailor their requests to the specific experience being presented. Each response adheres to a consistent API that resolves to a map of stage keys, enabling fast lookups and keeping business logic off the device. Our broadcast schema specifies WebSocket connection parameters, the current event stage, and the timestamp of the last broadcast message. When a device receives a broadcast, it injects the payload directly into its cache, triggering an immediate update and re-render of the interface.\\n\\n## Balancing the Moment: Throughput Management\\n\\nIn addition to building the new technology to support real-time recommendations, we also evaluated our existing systems for potential traffic hotspots. Using high-watermark traffic projections for live events, we generated synthetic traffic to simulate game-day scenarios and observed how our online services handled these bursts. Through this process, several common patterns emerged:\\n\\nBreaking the Cache Synchrony\\n\\nOur game-day simulations revealed that while our approach mitigated the immediate thundering herd risks driven by member traffic during the events, live events introduced unexpected mini thundering herds in our systems hours before and after the actual events. The surge of members joining just in time for these events led to concentrated cache expirations and recomputations, which created traffic spikes well outside the event window that we did not anticipate. This was not a problem for VOD content because the member traffic patterns are a lot smoother. We found that fixed TTLs caused cache expirations and refresh-traffic spikes to happen all at once. To address this, we added jitter to server and client cache expirations to spread out refreshes and smooth out traffic spikes.\\n\\nAdaptive Traffic Prioritization\\n\\nWhile our services already leverage traffic prioritization and partitioning based on factors such as request type and device type, live events introduced a distinct challenge. These events generated brief traffic bursts that were intensely spiky and placed significant strain on our systems. Through simulations, we recognized the need for an additional event-driven layer of traffic management.\\n\\nTo tackle this, we improved our traffic sharding strategies by using event-based signals. This enabled us to route live event traffic to dedicated clusters with more aggressive scaling policies. We also added a dynamic traffic prioritization ruleset that activates whenever we see high requests per second (RPS) to ensure our systems can handle the surge smoothly. During these peaks, we aggressively deprioritize non-critical server-driven updates so that our systems can devote resources to the most time-sensitive computations. This approach ensures smooth performance and reliability when demand is at its highest.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nWhen we set out to build a seamlessly scalable scheduled viewing experience, our goal was to create a dynamic and richer member experience for live content. Popular live events like the Crawford v. Canelo fight and the NFL Christmas games truly put our systems to the test. Along the way, we also uncovered valuable learnings that continue to shape our work. Our attempts to deprioritize traffic to other non-critical services caused unexpected call patterns and spikes in traffic elsewhere. Similarly, in hindsight, we also learned that the high traffic volume from popular events caused excessive non-essential logging and was putting unnecessary pressure on our ingestion pipelines.\\n\\nNone of this work would have been possible without our stunning colleagues at Netflix who collaborated across multiple functions to architect, build, and test these approaches, ensuring members can easily access events at the right moment: UI Engineering, Cloud Gateway, Data Science & Engineering, Search and Discovery, Evidence Engineering, Member Experience Foundations, Content Promotion and Distribution, Operations and Reliability, Device Playback, Experience and Design and Product Management.\\n\\nAs Netflix’s content offering expands to include new formats like live titles, free-to-air linear content, and games, we’re excited to build on what we’ve accomplished and look ahead to even more possibilities. Our roadmap includes extending the capabilities we developed for scheduled live viewing to these emerging formats. We’re also focused on enhancing our engineering tooling for greater visibility into operations, message delivery, and error handling to help us continue to deliver the best possible experience for our members.\\n\\n## Join Us for What’s Next\\n\\nWe’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible as we bring new live experiences to members around the world.

Generative recommenders (GRs) represent a new paradigm in the field of recommendation systems (e.g.HSTU,OneRec). These models draw inspiration from recent advancements in transformer architectures used for language and vision tasks. They approach the recommendation problem, including both ranking and retrieval, as a sequential transduction task. This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens. The reward model uses an open-sourced HSTU architecture in the convenience of reproducing this study. We adopt the standard RLHF approach of training a reward model using offline, human-collected feedback. We start by creating a proxy reward, scored on a scale from 1 to 5 in the convenience of understanding. This reward model is co-trained as a shallow reward head on top of the generative recommender. It predicts the reward for the most recently selected title based on a user’s interaction history. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare the model’s performance against two simple baselines: (1) predicting the next reward as the average reward the user has given in their past interactions, and (2) predicting it as the average reward that all users have assigned to that particular title in previous interactions.\\n\\nTable 1: Reward model performance metrics\\n\\nWe observe that the model’s predictions do not significantly outperform the simple baselines. This result is intuitive, as a user’s historical interactions typically cover only a small subset of titles, making it difficult to accurately predict their responses to the vast number of unexplored titles in the catalogue. We expect this to be a potential issue for any large recommendation systems where the ratio between explored and unexplored titles is very small.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\n3. Lack of Logged Policy\\n\\nIn recommendation systems, the policy that generated the logged data is typically unknown and cannot be directly estimated. Offline reinforcement learning methods often rely on Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to debias such data by reweighting interactions according to the logging policy’s action probabilities. However, estimating the logging policy accurately is challenging and prone to error, which can introduce additional biases, and IPS itself is known to suffer from high variance. Consequently, offline RL approaches that depend on IPS are ill-suited for our setting.\\n\\n## Advantage Weighted Supervised Fine Tuning\\n\\nGiven the three challenges outlined above, we propose a new algorithm Advantage-Weighted SFT (A-SFT). It leverages a combination of supervised fine-tuning and advantage reweighting from reinforcement learning. The key observation is as follows. Despite the reward estimation for each individual event having a high uncertainty, we find the estimations of rewards contain directional signals between high-reward and low-reward events. These signals could help better align the model during post-training.\\n\\nA central factor in this study is the generalization ability of the reward model. Better generalization enables more accurate predictions of user preferences for unseen titles, thereby making exploration more effective. For reward models with moderate to high generalization power, both online RL methods such as PPO and offline RL methods such as CQL can perform effectively. However, in our setting, reward model generalization is worse than the language counterparts’, which makes these algorithms less appropriate. In addition, the use of techniques like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) introduces a heightened risk of high-variance estimates, prompting us to exclude algorithms such as off-policy REINFORCE.\\n\\nOur proposed method A-SFT does not rely on IPS. With no need of prior knowledge of the logging policy, it can be generally applied to cases where observation of the environments are limited or biased. This is particularly useful to the recommendation setting due to the user feedback loop and distribution shifts with time. Without knowing the logging policy, A-SFT still provides means to control the policy deviation between the current policy and logging policy by tuning the parameter. This design provides essential means to control the learnt bias from uncertain reward models. We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1. Rejection Sampling Direct Preference Optimization / Identity Preference Optimization (RS DPO/IPO): this is a variant of DPO/IPO where, for each user history x, \\u200bwe generate contrasting response pairs by training an ensemble of reward models to estimate confidence intervals for the reward of multiple potential responses y. If the lower bound of the reward confidence interval for one response\\u200b is less than the upper bound for another response, then this pair is used to train DPO/IPO.\\n1. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL): This is a standard offline algorithm that learns a conservative Q function, penalizing overestimation of Q-values, particularly in regions of the state-action space with little or no reward data.\\n1. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): This is a standard RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) algorithm that uses reward models as an online environment. PPO learns an advantage function and optimizes the policy to maximize expected reward while maintaining proximity to the initial policy.\\n\\nWe sampled a separate test set of O(Millions) users. This test set is collected on a future date after the training.\\n\\n## Offline Evaluation Results\\n\\nWe evaluate our algorithm on a dataset of high-reward user trajectories. For sake of simplicity, we consider a trajectory to have a high reward if the accumulated reward is higher than the median of the population. We present the following metrics for the held out test dataset:\\n\\n1. NDCG@k: This measures the ranking quality of the recommended items up to position k. It accounts for the position of relevant items in the recommendation list, assigning higher scores when relevant items appear higher in the ranking. The gain is discounted logarithmically at lower ranks, and the result is normalized by the ideal ranking (i.e., the best possible ordering of items).\\n1. HR@k: This measures the proportion of test cases in which the ground-truth chosen item y appears in the top k recommendations. It is a binary metric per test case (hit or miss) and is averaged over all test cases.\\n1. MRR: MRR evaluates the ranking quality by measuring the reciprocal of the rank at which the chosen item appears in the recommendation list. The metric is averaged across all test cases.\\n1. Reward Model as A Judge: We use the reward model to evaluate the policy for future user events. We propose to use an ensemble of reward models for the evaluation to increase confidence. The result is based on the discounted reward generated for a few steps. The standard deviation is less than 4%.\\n\\nWe measure the percentage improvement in each metric compared to the baseline, Reward Weighted Behavior Cloning(BC). We notice that advantage weighted SFT shows the largest improvement in metrics, outweighing BC as well as reward model dependent algorithms like CQL, PPO, DPO and IPO.\\n\\nOur experiments show that advantage weighted SFT is a simple but promising approach for post-training generative recommenders as it deals with the issue of poor reward model generalizations and lack of IPS. More specifically, we find PPO, IPO and DPO achieve a good reward score, but also causes the overfitting from the reward model. Conservative Q-Learning achieves more robust improvements but does not fully capture the potential signals in the reward modeling. A-SFT achieved both better recommendation metrics and reward scores.', 'title': 'Post-Training Generative Recommenders with Advantage-Weighted Supervised Finetuning', 'url': 'https://netflixtechblog.com/post-training-generative-recommenders-with-advantage-weighted-supervised-finetuning-61a538d717a9?source=collection_home_page----2615bd06b42e-----0-----------------------------------'}, {'markdown': 'Author:Keertana Chidambaram,Qiuling Xu,Ko-Jen Hsiao,Moumita Bhattacharya\\n\\n(*The work was done when Keertana interned at Netflix.)\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThis blog focuses on post-training generative recommender systems.

The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens. The reward model uses an open-sourced HSTU architecture in the convenience of reproducing this study. We adopt the standard RLHF approach of training a reward model using offline, human-collected feedback. We start by creating a proxy reward, scored on a scale from 1 to 5 in the convenience of understanding. This reward model is co-trained as a shallow reward head on top of the generative recommender. It predicts the reward for the most recently selected title based on a user’s interaction history. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare the model’s performance against two simple baselines: (1) predicting the next reward as the average reward the user has given in their past interactions, and (2) predicting it as the average reward that all users have assigned to that particular title in previous interactions.\\n\\nTable 1: Reward model performance metrics\\n\\nWe observe that the model’s predictions do not significantly outperform the simple baselines. This result is intuitive, as a user’s historical interactions typically cover only a small subset of titles, making it difficult to accurately predict their responses to the vast number of unexplored titles in the catalogue. We expect this to be a potential issue for any large recommendation systems where the ratio between explored and unexplored titles is very small.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\n3. Lack of Logged Policy\\n\\nIn recommendation systems, the policy that generated the logged data is typically unknown and cannot be directly estimated. Offline reinforcement learning methods often rely on Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to debias such data by reweighting interactions according to the logging policy’s action probabilities. However, estimating the logging policy accurately is challenging and prone to error, which can introduce additional biases, and IPS itself is known to suffer from high variance. Consequently, offline RL approaches that depend on IPS are ill-suited for our setting.\\n\\n## Advantage Weighted Supervised Fine Tuning\\n\\nGiven the three challenges outlined above, we propose a new algorithm Advantage-Weighted SFT (A-SFT). It leverages a combination of supervised fine-tuning and advantage reweighting from reinforcement learning. The key observation is as follows. Despite the reward estimation for each individual event having a high uncertainty, we find the estimations of rewards contain directional signals between high-reward and low-reward events. These signals could help better align the model during post-training.\\n\\nA central factor in this study is the generalization ability of the reward model. Better generalization enables more accurate predictions of user preferences for unseen titles, thereby making exploration more effective. For reward models with moderate to high generalization power, both online RL methods such as PPO and offline RL methods such as CQL can perform effectively. However, in our setting, reward model generalization is worse than the language counterparts’, which makes these algorithms less appropriate. In addition, the use of techniques like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) introduces a heightened risk of high-variance estimates, prompting us to exclude algorithms such as off-policy REINFORCE.\\n\\nOur proposed method A-SFT does not rely on IPS. With no need of prior knowledge of the logging policy, it can be generally applied to cases where observation of the environments are limited or biased. This is particularly useful to the recommendation setting due to the user feedback loop and distribution shifts with time. Without knowing the logging policy, A-SFT still provides means to control the policy deviation between the current policy and logging policy by tuning the parameter. This design provides essential means to control the learnt bias from uncertain reward models. We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1. Rejection Sampling Direct Preference Optimization / Identity Preference Optimization (RS DPO/IPO): this is a variant of DPO/IPO where, for each user history x, \\u200bwe generate contrasting response pairs by training an ensemble of reward models to estimate confidence intervals for the reward of multiple potential responses y. If the lower bound of the reward confidence interval for one response\\u200b is less than the upper bound for another response, then this pair is used to train DPO/IPO.\\n1. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL): This is a standard offline algorithm that learns a conservative Q function, penalizing overestimation of Q-values, particularly in regions of the state-action space with little or no reward data.\\n1. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): This is a standard RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) algorithm that uses reward models as an online environment. PPO learns an advantage function and optimizes the policy to maximize expected reward while maintaining proximity to the initial policy.\\n\\nWe sampled a separate test set of O(Millions) users. This test set is collected on a future date after the training.\\n\\n## Offline Evaluation Results\\n\\nWe evaluate our algorithm on a dataset of high-reward user trajectories. For sake of simplicity, we consider a trajectory to have a high reward if the accumulated reward is higher than the median of the population. We present the following metrics for the held out test dataset:\\n\\n1. NDCG@k: This measures the ranking quality of the recommended items up to position k. It accounts for the position of relevant items in the recommendation list, assigning higher scores when relevant items appear higher in the ranking. The gain is discounted logarithmically at lower ranks, and the result is normalized by the ideal ranking (i.e., the best possible ordering of items).\\n1. HR@k: This measures the proportion of test cases in which the ground-truth chosen item y appears in the top k recommendations. It is a binary metric per test case (hit or miss) and is averaged over all test cases.\\n1. MRR: MRR evaluates the ranking quality by measuring the reciprocal of the rank at which the chosen item appears in the recommendation list. The metric is averaged across all test cases.\\n1. Reward Model as A Judge: We use the reward model to evaluate the policy for future user events. We propose to use an ensemble of reward models for the evaluation to increase confidence. The result is based on the discounted reward generated for a few steps. The standard deviation is less than 4%.\\n\\nWe measure the percentage improvement in each metric compared to the baseline, Reward Weighted Behavior Cloning(BC). We notice that advantage weighted SFT shows the largest improvement in metrics, outweighing BC as well as reward model dependent algorithms like CQL, PPO, DPO and IPO.\\n\\nOur experiments show that advantage weighted SFT is a simple but promising approach for post-training generative recommenders as it deals with the issue of poor reward model generalizations and lack of IPS. More specifically, we find PPO, IPO and DPO achieve a good reward score, but also causes the overfitting from the reward model. Conservative Q-Learning achieves more robust improvements but does not fully capture the potential signals in the reward modeling.

Check outpart 1andpart 2to learn more.\\n\\nPicture this: It’s seconds before the biggest fight night in Netflix history. Sixty-five million fans are waiting, devices in hand, hearts pounding. The countdown hits zero. What does it take to get everyone to the action on time, every time? At Netflix, we’re used to on-demand viewing where everyone chooses their own moment. But with live events, millions are eager to join in at once. Our job: make sure our members never miss a beat.\\n\\nWhen Live events break streaming records¹²³, our infrastructure faces the ultimate stress test. Here’s how we engineered a discovery experience for a global audience excited to see a knockout.\\n\\n## Why are Live Events Different?\\n\\nUnlike Video on Demand (VOD), members want to catch live events as they happen. There’s something uniquely exciting about being part of the moment. That means we only have a brief window to recommend a Live event at just the right time. Too early, excitement fades; too late, the moment is missed. Every second counts.\\n\\nTo capture that excitement, we enhanced our recommendation delivery systems to serve real-time suggestions, providing members richer and more compelling signals to hit play in the moment when it matters most. The challenge? Sending dynamic, timely updates concurrently to over a hundred million devices worldwide without creating athundering herd effectthat would overwhelm our cloud services. Simply scaling up linearly isn’t efficient and reliable. For popular events, it could also divert resources from other critical services. We needed a smarter and more scalable solution than just adding more resources.\\n\\n## Orchestrating the moment: Real-time Recommendations\\n\\nWith millions of devices online and live event schedules that can shift in real time, the challenge was to keep everyone perfectly in sync. We set out to solve this by building a system that doesn’t just react, but adapts by dynamically updating recommendations as the event unfolds. We identified the need to balance three constraints:\\n\\n* Time: the duration required to coordinate an update.\\n* Request throughput:the capacity of our cloud services to handle requests.\\n* Compute cardinality: the variety of requests necessary to serve a unique update.\\n\\nWe solved this constraint optimization problem by splitting the real-time recommendations into two phases:prefetchingandreal-time broadcasting. First, we prefetch the necessary data ahead of time, distributing the load over a longer period to avoid traffic spikes. When the Live event starts or ends, we broadcast a low cardinality message to all connected devices, prompting them to use the prefetched data locally. The timing of the broadcast also adapts when event times shift to preserve accuracy with the production of the Live event. By combining these two phases, we’re able to keep our members’ devices in sync and solve the thundering herd problem. To maximize device reach, especially for those with unstable networks, we use “at least once” broadcasts to ensure every device gets the latest updates and can catch up on any previously missed broadcasts as soon as they’re back online.\\n\\nThe first phase optimizesrequest throughputandcompute cardinalityby prefetching materialized recommendations, displayed title metadata, and artwork for a Live event. As members naturally browse their devices before the event, this data is prepopulated and stored locally in device cache, awaiting the notification trigger to serve the recommendations instantaneously. By distributing these requests naturally over time ahead of the event, we can eliminate any related traffic spikes and avoid the need for large-scale, real-time system scaling.\\n\\nThe second phase optimizesrequest throughputandtimeto updatedevices by broadcasting a low-cardinality, real-time message to all connected devices at critical moments in a Live event’s lifecycle. Each broadcast payload includes astate keyand atimestamp. The state key indicates the current stage of the Live event, allowing devices to use their pre-fetched data to update cached responses locally without additional server requests. The timestamp ensures that if a device misses a broadcast due to network issues, it can catch up by replaying missed updates upon reconnecting. This mechanism guarantees devices receive updates at least once, significantly increasing delivery reliability even on unstable networks.\\n\\n> Moment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\nMoment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\n## Under the Hood: How It Works\\n\\nWith the big picture in mind, let’s examine how these pieces interact in practice.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\nIn the diagram below, the Message Producer microservice centralizes all of the business logic. It continuously monitors live events for setup and timing changes. When it detects an update, it schedules broadcasts to be sent at precisely the right moment. The Message Producer also standardizes communication by providing a concise GraphQL schema for both device queries and broadcast payloads.\\n\\nRather than sending broadcasts directly to devices via WebSocket, the Message Producer hands them off to the Message Router. The Message Router is part of a robust two-tier pub/sub architecture built on proven technologies likePushy(our WebSocket proxy), Apache Kafka, andNetflix’s KV key-value store. The Message Router tracks subscriptions at the Pushy node granularity, while Pushy nodes map the subscriptions to individual connections, creating a low-latency fanout that minimizes compute and bandwidth requirements.\\n\\nDevices interface with our GraphQLDomain Graph Service (DGS). These schemas offer multiple query interfaces for prefetching, allowing devices to tailor their requests to the specific experience being presented. Each response adheres to a consistent API that resolves to a map of stage keys, enabling fast lookups and keeping business logic off the device. Our broadcast schema specifies WebSocket connection parameters, the current event stage, and the timestamp of the last broadcast message. When a device receives a broadcast, it injects the payload directly into its cache, triggering an immediate update and re-render of the interface.\\n\\n## Balancing the Moment: Throughput Management\\n\\nIn addition to building the new technology to support real-time recommendations, we also evaluated our existing systems for potential traffic hotspots. Using high-watermark traffic projections for live events, we generated synthetic traffic to simulate game-day scenarios and observed how our online services handled these bursts. Through this process, several common patterns emerged:\\n\\nBreaking the Cache Synchrony\\n\\nOur game-day simulations revealed that while our approach mitigated the immediate thundering herd risks driven by member traffic during the events, live events introduced unexpected mini thundering herds in our systems hours before and after the actual events. The surge of members joining just in time for these events led to concentrated cache expirations and recomputations, which created traffic spikes well outside the event window that we did not anticipate. This was not a problem for VOD content because the member traffic patterns are a lot smoother. We found that fixed TTLs caused cache expirations and refresh-traffic spikes to happen all at once. To address this, we added jitter to server and client cache expirations to spread out refreshes and smooth out traffic spikes.\\n\\nAdaptive Traffic Prioritization\\n\\nWhile our services already leverage traffic prioritization and partitioning based on factors such as request type and device type, live events introduced a distinct challenge. These events generated brief traffic bursts that were intensely spiky and placed significant strain on our systems. Through simulations, we recognized the need for an additional event-driven layer of traffic management.\\n\\nTo tackle this, we improved our traffic sharding strategies by using event-based signals. This enabled us to route live event traffic to dedicated clusters with more aggressive scaling policies. We also added a dynamic traffic prioritization ruleset that activates whenever we see high requests per second (RPS) to ensure our systems can handle the surge smoothly. During these peaks, we aggressively deprioritize non-critical server-driven updates so that our systems can devote resources to the most time-sensitive computations. This approach ensures smooth performance and reliability when demand is at its highest.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nWhen we set out to build a seamlessly scalable scheduled viewing experience, our goal was to create a dynamic and richer member experience for live content. Popular live events like the Crawford v. Canelo fight and the NFL Christmas games truly put our systems to the test. Along the way, we also uncovered valuable learnings that continue to shape our work. Our attempts to deprioritize traffic to other non-critical services caused unexpected call patterns and spikes in traffic elsewhere. Similarly, in hindsight, we also learned that the high traffic volume from popular events caused excessive non-essential logging and was putting unnecessary pressure on our ingestion pipelines.\\n\\nNone of this work would have been possible without our stunning colleagues at Netflix who collaborated across multiple functions to architect, build, and test these approaches, ensuring members can easily access events at the right moment: UI Engineering, Cloud Gateway, Data Science & Engineering, Search and Discovery, Evidence Engineering, Member Experience Foundations, Content Promotion and Distribution, Operations and Reliability, Device Playback, Experience and Design and Product Management.\\n\\nAs Netflix’s content offering expands to include new formats like live titles, free-to-air linear content, and games, we’re excited to build on what we’ve accomplished and look ahead to even more possibilities. Our roadmap includes extending the capabilities we developed for scheduled live viewing to these emerging formats. We’re also focused on enhancing our engineering tooling for greater visibility into operations, message delivery, and error handling to help us continue to deliver the best possible experience for our members.\\n\\n## Join Us for What’s Next\\n\\nWe’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible as we bring new live experiences to members around the world.

Generative recommenders (GRs) represent a new paradigm in the field of recommendation systems (e.g.HSTU,OneRec). These models draw inspiration from recent advancements in transformer architectures used for language and vision tasks. They approach the recommendation problem, including both ranking and retrieval, as a sequential transduction task. This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens. The reward model uses an open-sourced HSTU architecture in the convenience of reproducing this study. We adopt the standard RLHF approach of training a reward model using offline, human-collected feedback. We start by creating a proxy reward, scored on a scale from 1 to 5 in the convenience of understanding. This reward model is co-trained as a shallow reward head on top of the generative recommender. It predicts the reward for the most recently selected title based on a user’s interaction history. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare the model’s performance against two simple baselines: (1) predicting the next reward as the average reward the user has given in their past interactions, and (2) predicting it as the average reward that all users have assigned to that particular title in previous interactions.\\n\\nTable 1: Reward model performance metrics\\n\\nWe observe that the model’s predictions do not significantly outperform the simple baselines. This result is intuitive, as a user’s historical interactions typically cover only a small subset of titles, making it difficult to accurately predict their responses to the vast number of unexplored titles in the catalogue. We expect this to be a potential issue for any large recommendation systems where the ratio between explored and unexplored titles is very small.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\n3. Lack of Logged Policy\\n\\nIn recommendation systems, the policy that generated the logged data is typically unknown and cannot be directly estimated. Offline reinforcement learning methods often rely on Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to debias such data by reweighting interactions according to the logging policy’s action probabilities. However, estimating the logging policy accurately is challenging and prone to error, which can introduce additional biases, and IPS itself is known to suffer from high variance. Consequently, offline RL approaches that depend on IPS are ill-suited for our setting.\\n\\n## Advantage Weighted Supervised Fine Tuning\\n\\nGiven the three challenges outlined above, we propose a new algorithm Advantage-Weighted SFT (A-SFT). It leverages a combination of supervised fine-tuning and advantage reweighting from reinforcement learning. The key observation is as follows. Despite the reward estimation for each individual event having a high uncertainty, we find the estimations of rewards contain directional signals between high-reward and low-reward events. These signals could help better align the model during post-training.\\n\\nA central factor in this study is the generalization ability of the reward model. Better generalization enables more accurate predictions of user preferences for unseen titles, thereby making exploration more effective. For reward models with moderate to high generalization power, both online RL methods such as PPO and offline RL methods such as CQL can perform effectively. However, in our setting, reward model generalization is worse than the language counterparts’, which makes these algorithms less appropriate. In addition, the use of techniques like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) introduces a heightened risk of high-variance estimates, prompting us to exclude algorithms such as off-policy REINFORCE.\\n\\nOur proposed method A-SFT does not rely on IPS. With no need of prior knowledge of the logging policy, it can be generally applied to cases where observation of the environments are limited or biased. This is particularly useful to the recommendation setting due to the user feedback loop and distribution shifts with time. Without knowing the logging policy, A-SFT still provides means to control the policy deviation between the current policy and logging policy by tuning the parameter. This design provides essential means to control the learnt bias from uncertain reward models. We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1. Rejection Sampling Direct Preference Optimization / Identity Preference Optimization (RS DPO/IPO): this is a variant of DPO/IPO where, for each user history x, \\u200bwe generate contrasting response pairs by training an ensemble of reward models to estimate confidence intervals for the reward of multiple potential responses y. If the lower bound of the reward confidence interval for one response\\u200b is less than the upper bound for another response, then this pair is used to train DPO/IPO.\\n1. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL): This is a standard offline algorithm that learns a conservative Q function, penalizing overestimation of Q-values, particularly in regions of the state-action space with little or no reward data.\\n1. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): This is a standard RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) algorithm that uses reward models as an online environment. PPO learns an advantage function and optimizes the policy to maximize expected reward while maintaining proximity to the initial policy.\\n\\nWe sampled a separate test set of O(Millions) users. This test set is collected on a future date after the training.\\n\\n## Offline Evaluation Results\\n\\nWe evaluate our algorithm on a dataset of high-reward user trajectories. For sake of simplicity, we consider a trajectory to have a high reward if the accumulated reward is higher than the median of the population. We present the following metrics for the held out test dataset:\\n\\n1. NDCG@k: This measures the ranking quality of the recommended items up to position k. It accounts for the position of relevant items in the recommendation list, assigning higher scores when relevant items appear higher in the ranking. The gain is discounted logarithmically at lower ranks, and the result is normalized by the ideal ranking (i.e., the best possible ordering of items).\\n1. HR@k: This measures the proportion of test cases in which the ground-truth chosen item y appears in the top k recommendations. It is a binary metric per test case (hit or miss) and is averaged over all test cases.\\n1. MRR: MRR evaluates the ranking quality by measuring the reciprocal of the rank at which the chosen item appears in the recommendation list. The metric is averaged across all test cases.\\n1. Reward Model as A Judge: We use the reward model to evaluate the policy for future user events. We propose to use an ensemble of reward models for the evaluation to increase confidence. The result is based on the discounted reward generated for a few steps. The standard deviation is less than 4%.\\n\\nWe measure the percentage improvement in each metric compared to the baseline, Reward Weighted Behavior Cloning(BC). We notice that advantage weighted SFT shows the largest improvement in metrics, outweighing BC as well as reward model dependent algorithms like CQL, PPO, DPO and IPO.\\n\\nOur experiments show that advantage weighted SFT is a simple but promising approach for post-training generative recommenders as it deals with the issue of poor reward model generalizations and lack of IPS. More specifically, we find PPO, IPO and DPO achieve a good reward score, but also causes the overfitting from the reward model. Conservative Q-Learning achieves more robust improvements but does not fully capture the potential signals in the reward modeling. A-SFT achieved both better recommendation metrics and reward scores.', 'title': 'Post-Training Generative Recommenders with Advantage-Weighted Supervised Finetuning', 'url': 'https://netflixtechblog.com/post-training-generative-recommenders-with-advantage-weighted-supervised-finetuning-61a538d717a9?source=collection_home_page----2615bd06b42e-----0-----------------------------------'}, {'markdown': 'Author:Keertana Chidambaram,Qiuling Xu,Ko-Jen Hsiao,Moumita Bhattacharya\\n\\n(*The work was done when Keertana interned at Netflix.)\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThis blog focuses on post-training generative recommender systems.

We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1. Rejection Sampling Direct Preference Optimization / Identity Preference Optimization (RS DPO/IPO): this is a variant of DPO/IPO where, for each user history x, \\u200bwe generate contrasting response pairs by training an ensemble of reward models to estimate confidence intervals for the reward of multiple potential responses y. If the lower bound of the reward confidence interval for one response\\u200b is less than the upper bound for another response, then this pair is used to train DPO/IPO.\\n1. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL): This is a standard offline algorithm that learns a conservative Q function, penalizing overestimation of Q-values, particularly in regions of the state-action space with little or no reward data.\\n1. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): This is a standard RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) algorithm that uses reward models as an online environment. PPO learns an advantage function and optimizes the policy to maximize expected reward while maintaining proximity to the initial policy.\\n\\nWe sampled a separate test set of O(Millions) users. This test set is collected on a future date after the training.\\n\\n## Offline Evaluation Results\\n\\nWe evaluate our algorithm on a dataset of high-reward user trajectories. For sake of simplicity, we consider a trajectory to have a high reward if the accumulated reward is higher than the median of the population. We present the following metrics for the held out test dataset:\\n\\n1. NDCG@k: This measures the ranking quality of the recommended items up to position k. It accounts for the position of relevant items in the recommendation list, assigning higher scores when relevant items appear higher in the ranking. The gain is discounted logarithmically at lower ranks, and the result is normalized by the ideal ranking (i.e., the best possible ordering of items).\\n1. HR@k: This measures the proportion of test cases in which the ground-truth chosen item y appears in the top k recommendations. It is a binary metric per test case (hit or miss) and is averaged over all test cases.\\n1. MRR: MRR evaluates the ranking quality by measuring the reciprocal of the rank at which the chosen item appears in the recommendation list. The metric is averaged across all test cases.\\n1. Reward Model as A Judge: We use the reward model to evaluate the policy for future user events. We propose to use an ensemble of reward models for the evaluation to increase confidence. The result is based on the discounted reward generated for a few steps. The standard deviation is less than 4%.\\n\\nWe measure the percentage improvement in each metric compared to the baseline, Reward Weighted Behavior Cloning(BC). We notice that advantage weighted SFT shows the largest improvement in metrics, outweighing BC as well as reward model dependent algorithms like CQL, PPO, DPO and IPO.\\n\\nOur experiments show that advantage weighted SFT is a simple but promising approach for post-training generative recommenders as it deals with the issue of poor reward model generalizations and lack of IPS. More specifically, we find PPO, IPO and DPO achieve a good reward score, but also causes the overfitting from the reward model. Conservative Q-Learning achieves more robust improvements but does not fully capture the potential signals in the reward modeling. A-SFT achieved both better recommendation metrics and reward scores.', 'title': 'Post-Training Generative Recommenders with Advantage-Weighted Supervised Finetuning', 'url': 'https://netflixtechblog.com/post-training-generative-recommenders-with-advantage-weighted-supervised-finetuning-61a538d717a9?source=collection_home_page----2615bd06b42e-----0-----------------------------------'}, {'markdown': 'By:Kris Range,Ankush Gulati,Jim Isaacs,Jennifer Shin,Jeremy Kelly,Jason Tu\\n\\nThis is part 3 in a series called “Behind the Streams”. Check outpart 1andpart 2to learn more.\\n\\nPicture this: It’s seconds before the biggest fight night in Netflix history. Sixty-five million fans are waiting, devices in hand, hearts pounding. The countdown hits zero. What does it take to get everyone to the action on time, every time? At Netflix, we’re used to on-demand viewing where everyone chooses their own moment. But with live events, millions are eager to join in at once. Our job: make sure our members never miss a beat.\\n\\nWhen Live events break streaming records¹²³, our infrastructure faces the ultimate stress test. Here’s how we engineered a discovery experience for a global audience excited to see a knockout.\\n\\n## Why are Live Events Different?\\n\\nUnlike Video on Demand (VOD), members want to catch live events as they happen. There’s something uniquely exciting about being part of the moment. That means we only have a brief window to recommend a Live event at just the right time. Too early, excitement fades; too late, the moment is missed. Every second counts.\\n\\nTo capture that excitement, we enhanced our recommendation delivery systems to serve real-time suggestions, providing members richer and more compelling signals to hit play in the moment when it matters most. The challenge? Sending dynamic, timely updates concurrently to over a hundred million devices worldwide without creating athundering herd effectthat would overwhelm our cloud services. Simply scaling up linearly isn’t efficient and reliable. For popular events, it could also divert resources from other critical services. We needed a smarter and more scalable solution than just adding more resources.\\n\\n## Orchestrating the moment: Real-time Recommendations\\n\\nWith millions of devices online and live event schedules that can shift in real time, the challenge was to keep everyone perfectly in sync. We set out to solve this by building a system that doesn’t just react, but adapts by dynamically updating recommendations as the event unfolds. We identified the need to balance three constraints:\\n\\n* Time: the duration required to coordinate an update.\\n* Request throughput:the capacity of our cloud services to handle requests.\\n* Compute cardinality: the variety of requests necessary to serve a unique update.\\n\\nWe solved this constraint optimization problem by splitting the real-time recommendations into two phases:prefetchingandreal-time broadcasting. First, we prefetch the necessary data ahead of time, distributing the load over a longer period to avoid traffic spikes. When the Live event starts or ends, we broadcast a low cardinality message to all connected devices, prompting them to use the prefetched data locally. The timing of the broadcast also adapts when event times shift to preserve accuracy with the production of the Live event. By combining these two phases, we’re able to keep our members’ devices in sync and solve the thundering herd problem. To maximize device reach, especially for those with unstable networks, we use “at least once” broadcasts to ensure every device gets the latest updates and can catch up on any previously missed broadcasts as soon as they’re back online.\\n\\nThe first phase optimizesrequest throughputandcompute cardinalityby prefetching materialized recommendations, displayed title metadata, and artwork for a Live event. As members naturally browse their devices before the event, this data is prepopulated and stored locally in device cache, awaiting the notification trigger to serve the recommendations instantaneously. By distributing these requests naturally over time ahead of the event, we can eliminate any related traffic spikes and avoid the need for large-scale, real-time system scaling.\\n\\nThe second phase optimizesrequest throughputandtimeto updatedevices by broadcasting a low-cardinality, real-time message to all connected devices at critical moments in a Live event’s lifecycle. Each broadcast payload includes astate keyand atimestamp. The state key indicates the current stage of the Live event, allowing devices to use their pre-fetched data to update cached responses locally without additional server requests. The timestamp ensures that if a device misses a broadcast due to network issues, it can catch up by replaying missed updates upon reconnecting. This mechanism guarantees devices receive updates at least once, significantly increasing delivery reliability even on unstable networks.\\n\\n> Moment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\nMoment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\n## Under the Hood: How It Works\\n\\nWith the big picture in mind, let’s examine how these pieces interact in practice.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\nIn the diagram below, the Message Producer microservice centralizes all of the business logic. It continuously monitors live events for setup and timing changes. When it detects an update, it schedules broadcasts to be sent at precisely the right moment. The Message Producer also standardizes communication by providing a concise GraphQL schema for both device queries and broadcast payloads.\\n\\nRather than sending broadcasts directly to devices via WebSocket, the Message Producer hands them off to the Message Router. The Message Router is part of a robust two-tier pub/sub architecture built on proven technologies likePushy(our WebSocket proxy), Apache Kafka, andNetflix’s KV key-value store. The Message Router tracks subscriptions at the Pushy node granularity, while Pushy nodes map the subscriptions to individual connections, creating a low-latency fanout that minimizes compute and bandwidth requirements.\\n\\nDevices interface with our GraphQLDomain Graph Service (DGS). These schemas offer multiple query interfaces for prefetching, allowing devices to tailor their requests to the specific experience being presented. Each response adheres to a consistent API that resolves to a map of stage keys, enabling fast lookups and keeping business logic off the device. Our broadcast schema specifies WebSocket connection parameters, the current event stage, and the timestamp of the last broadcast message. When a device receives a broadcast, it injects the payload directly into its cache, triggering an immediate update and re-render of the interface.\\n\\n## Balancing the Moment: Throughput Management\\n\\nIn addition to building the new technology to support real-time recommendations, we also evaluated our existing systems for potential traffic hotspots. Using high-watermark traffic projections for live events, we generated synthetic traffic to simulate game-day scenarios and observed how our online services handled these bursts. Through this process, several common patterns emerged:\\n\\nBreaking the Cache Synchrony\\n\\nOur game-day simulations revealed that while our approach mitigated the immediate thundering herd risks driven by member traffic during the events, live events introduced unexpected mini thundering herds in our systems hours before and after the actual events. The surge of members joining just in time for these events led to concentrated cache expirations and recomputations, which created traffic spikes well outside the event window that we did not anticipate. This was not a problem for VOD content because the member traffic patterns are a lot smoother. We found that fixed TTLs caused cache expirations and refresh-traffic spikes to happen all at once. To address this, we added jitter to server and client cache expirations to spread out refreshes and smooth out traffic spikes.\\n\\nAdaptive Traffic Prioritization\\n\\nWhile our services already leverage traffic prioritization and partitioning based on factors such as request type and device type, live events introduced a distinct challenge. These events generated brief traffic bursts that were intensely spiky and placed significant strain on our systems. Through simulations, we recognized the need for an additional event-driven layer of traffic management.\\n\\nTo tackle this, we improved our traffic sharding strategies by using event-based signals. This enabled us to route live event traffic to dedicated clusters with more aggressive scaling policies. We also added a dynamic traffic prioritization ruleset that activates whenever we see high requests per second (RPS) to ensure our systems can handle the surge smoothly. During these peaks, we aggressively deprioritize non-critical server-driven updates so that our systems can devote resources to the most time-sensitive computations. This approach ensures smooth performance and reliability when demand is at its highest.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nWhen we set out to build a seamlessly scalable scheduled viewing experience, our goal was to create a dynamic and richer member experience for live content. Popular live events like the Crawford v. Canelo fight and the NFL Christmas games truly put our systems to the test. Along the way, we also uncovered valuable learnings that continue to shape our work. Our attempts to deprioritize traffic to other non-critical services caused unexpected call patterns and spikes in traffic elsewhere. Similarly, in hindsight, we also learned that the high traffic volume from popular events caused excessive non-essential logging and was putting unnecessary pressure on our ingestion pipelines.\\n\\nNone of this work would have been possible without our stunning colleagues at Netflix who collaborated across multiple functions to architect, build, and test these approaches, ensuring members can easily access events at the right moment: UI Engineering, Cloud Gateway, Data Science & Engineering, Search and Discovery, Evidence Engineering, Member Experience Foundations, Content Promotion and Distribution, Operations and Reliability, Device Playback, Experience and Design and Product Management.\\n\\nAs Netflix’s content offering expands to include new formats like live titles, free-to-air linear content, and games, we’re excited to build on what we’ve accomplished and look ahead to even more possibilities. Our roadmap includes extending the capabilities we developed for scheduled live viewing to these emerging formats. We’re also focused on enhancing our engineering tooling for greater visibility into operations, message delivery, and error handling to help us continue to deliver the best possible experience for our members.\\n\\n## Join Us for What’s Next\\n\\nWe’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible as we bring new live experiences to members around the world.

Generative recommenders (GRs) represent a new paradigm in the field of recommendation systems (e.g.HSTU,OneRec). These models draw inspiration from recent advancements in transformer architectures used for language and vision tasks. They approach the recommendation problem, including both ranking and retrieval, as a sequential transduction task. This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens. The reward model uses an open-sourced HSTU architecture in the convenience of reproducing this study. We adopt the standard RLHF approach of training a reward model using offline, human-collected feedback. We start by creating a proxy reward, scored on a scale from 1 to 5 in the convenience of understanding. This reward model is co-trained as a shallow reward head on top of the generative recommender. It predicts the reward for the most recently selected title based on a user’s interaction history. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare the model’s performance against two simple baselines: (1) predicting the next reward as the average reward the user has given in their past interactions, and (2) predicting it as the average reward that all users have assigned to that particular title in previous interactions.\\n\\nTable 1: Reward model performance metrics\\n\\nWe observe that the model’s predictions do not significantly outperform the simple baselines. This result is intuitive, as a user’s historical interactions typically cover only a small subset of titles, making it difficult to accurately predict their responses to the vast number of unexplored titles in the catalogue. We expect this to be a potential issue for any large recommendation systems where the ratio between explored and unexplored titles is very small.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\n3. Lack of Logged Policy\\n\\nIn recommendation systems, the policy that generated the logged data is typically unknown and cannot be directly estimated. Offline reinforcement learning methods often rely on Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to debias such data by reweighting interactions according to the logging policy’s action probabilities. However, estimating the logging policy accurately is challenging and prone to error, which can introduce additional biases, and IPS itself is known to suffer from high variance. Consequently, offline RL approaches that depend on IPS are ill-suited for our setting.\\n\\n## Advantage Weighted Supervised Fine Tuning\\n\\nGiven the three challenges outlined above, we propose a new algorithm Advantage-Weighted SFT (A-SFT). It leverages a combination of supervised fine-tuning and advantage reweighting from reinforcement learning. The key observation is as follows. Despite the reward estimation for each individual event having a high uncertainty, we find the estimations of rewards contain directional signals between high-reward and low-reward events. These signals could help better align the model during post-training.\\n\\nA central factor in this study is the generalization ability of the reward model. Better generalization enables more accurate predictions of user preferences for unseen titles, thereby making exploration more effective. For reward models with moderate to high generalization power, both online RL methods such as PPO and offline RL methods such as CQL can perform effectively. However, in our setting, reward model generalization is worse than the language counterparts’, which makes these algorithms less appropriate. In addition, the use of techniques like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) introduces a heightened risk of high-variance estimates, prompting us to exclude algorithms such as off-policy REINFORCE.\\n\\nOur proposed method A-SFT does not rely on IPS. With no need of prior knowledge of the logging policy, it can be generally applied to cases where observation of the environments are limited or biased. This is particularly useful to the recommendation setting due to the user feedback loop and distribution shifts with time. Without knowing the logging policy, A-SFT still provides means to control the policy deviation between the current policy and logging policy by tuning the parameter. This design provides essential means to control the learnt bias from uncertain reward models. We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1. Rejection Sampling Direct Preference Optimization / Identity Preference Optimization (RS DPO/IPO): this is a variant of DPO/IPO where, for each user history x, \\u200bwe generate contrasting response pairs by training an ensemble of reward models to estimate confidence intervals for the reward of multiple potential responses y. If the lower bound of the reward confidence interval for one response\\u200b is less than the upper bound for another response, then this pair is used to train DPO/IPO.\\n1. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL): This is a standard offline algorithm that learns a conservative Q function, penalizing overestimation of Q-values, particularly in regions of the state-action space with little or no reward data.\\n1. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): This is a standard RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) algorithm that uses reward models as an online environment. PPO learns an advantage function and optimizes the policy to maximize expected reward while maintaining proximity to the initial policy.\\n\\nWe sampled a separate test set of O(Millions) users. This test set is collected on a future date after the training.\\n\\n## Offline Evaluation Results\\n\\nWe evaluate our algorithm on a dataset of high-reward user trajectories. For sake of simplicity, we consider a trajectory to have a high reward if the accumulated reward is higher than the median of the population. We present the following metrics for the held out test dataset:\\n\\n1. NDCG@k: This measures the ranking quality of the recommended items up to position k. It accounts for the position of relevant items in the recommendation list, assigning higher scores when relevant items appear higher in the ranking. The gain is discounted logarithmically at lower ranks, and the result is normalized by the ideal ranking (i.e., the best possible ordering of items).\\n1. HR@k: This measures the proportion of test cases in which the ground-truth chosen item y appears in the top k recommendations. It is a binary metric per test case (hit or miss) and is averaged over all test cases.\\n1. MRR: MRR evaluates the ranking quality by measuring the reciprocal of the rank at which the chosen item appears in the recommendation list. The metric is averaged across all test cases.\\n1. Reward Model as A Judge: We use the reward model to evaluate the policy for future user events. We propose to use an ensemble of reward models for the evaluation to increase confidence. The result is based on the discounted reward generated for a few steps. The standard deviation is less than 4%.\\n\\nWe measure the percentage improvement in each metric compared to the baseline, Reward Weighted Behavior Cloning(BC). We notice that advantage weighted SFT shows the largest improvement in metrics, outweighing BC as well as reward model dependent algorithms like CQL, PPO, DPO and IPO.\\n\\nOur experiments show that advantage weighted SFT is a simple but promising approach for post-training generative recommenders as it deals with the issue of poor reward model generalizations and lack of IPS. More specifically, we find PPO, IPO and DPO achieve a good reward score, but also causes the overfitting from the reward model. Conservative Q-Learning achieves more robust improvements but does not fully capture the potential signals in the reward modeling.

Check outpart 1andpart 2to learn more.\\n\\nPicture this: It’s seconds before the biggest fight night in Netflix history. Sixty-five million fans are waiting, devices in hand, hearts pounding. The countdown hits zero. What does it take to get everyone to the action on time, every time? At Netflix, we’re used to on-demand viewing where everyone chooses their own moment. But with live events, millions are eager to join in at once. Our job: make sure our members never miss a beat.\\n\\nWhen Live events break streaming records¹²³, our infrastructure faces the ultimate stress test. Here’s how we engineered a discovery experience for a global audience excited to see a knockout.\\n\\n## Why are Live Events Different?\\n\\nUnlike Video on Demand (VOD), members want to catch live events as they happen. There’s something uniquely exciting about being part of the moment. That means we only have a brief window to recommend a Live event at just the right time. Too early, excitement fades; too late, the moment is missed. Every second counts.\\n\\nTo capture that excitement, we enhanced our recommendation delivery systems to serve real-time suggestions, providing members richer and more compelling signals to hit play in the moment when it matters most. The challenge? Sending dynamic, timely updates concurrently to over a hundred million devices worldwide without creating athundering herd effectthat would overwhelm our cloud services. Simply scaling up linearly isn’t efficient and reliable. For popular events, it could also divert resources from other critical services. We needed a smarter and more scalable solution than just adding more resources.\\n\\n## Orchestrating the moment: Real-time Recommendations\\n\\nWith millions of devices online and live event schedules that can shift in real time, the challenge was to keep everyone perfectly in sync. We set out to solve this by building a system that doesn’t just react, but adapts by dynamically updating recommendations as the event unfolds. We identified the need to balance three constraints:\\n\\n* Time: the duration required to coordinate an update.\\n* Request throughput:the capacity of our cloud services to handle requests.\\n* Compute cardinality: the variety of requests necessary to serve a unique update.\\n\\nWe solved this constraint optimization problem by splitting the real-time recommendations into two phases:prefetchingandreal-time broadcasting. First, we prefetch the necessary data ahead of time, distributing the load over a longer period to avoid traffic spikes. When the Live event starts or ends, we broadcast a low cardinality message to all connected devices, prompting them to use the prefetched data locally. The timing of the broadcast also adapts when event times shift to preserve accuracy with the production of the Live event. By combining these two phases, we’re able to keep our members’ devices in sync and solve the thundering herd problem. To maximize device reach, especially for those with unstable networks, we use “at least once” broadcasts to ensure every device gets the latest updates and can catch up on any previously missed broadcasts as soon as they’re back online.\\n\\nThe first phase optimizesrequest throughputandcompute cardinalityby prefetching materialized recommendations, displayed title metadata, and artwork for a Live event. As members naturally browse their devices before the event, this data is prepopulated and stored locally in device cache, awaiting the notification trigger to serve the recommendations instantaneously. By distributing these requests naturally over time ahead of the event, we can eliminate any related traffic spikes and avoid the need for large-scale, real-time system scaling.\\n\\nThe second phase optimizesrequest throughputandtimeto updatedevices by broadcasting a low-cardinality, real-time message to all connected devices at critical moments in a Live event’s lifecycle. Each broadcast payload includes astate keyand atimestamp. The state key indicates the current stage of the Live event, allowing devices to use their pre-fetched data to update cached responses locally without additional server requests. The timestamp ensures that if a device misses a broadcast due to network issues, it can catch up by replaying missed updates upon reconnecting. This mechanism guarantees devices receive updates at least once, significantly increasing delivery reliability even on unstable networks.\\n\\n> Moment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\nMoment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\n## Under the Hood: How It Works\\n\\nWith the big picture in mind, let’s examine how these pieces interact in practice.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\nIn the diagram below, the Message Producer microservice centralizes all of the business logic. It continuously monitors live events for setup and timing changes. When it detects an update, it schedules broadcasts to be sent at precisely the right moment. The Message Producer also standardizes communication by providing a concise GraphQL schema for both device queries and broadcast payloads.\\n\\nRather than sending broadcasts directly to devices via WebSocket, the Message Producer hands them off to the Message Router. The Message Router is part of a robust two-tier pub/sub architecture built on proven technologies likePushy(our WebSocket proxy), Apache Kafka, andNetflix’s KV key-value store. The Message Router tracks subscriptions at the Pushy node granularity, while Pushy nodes map the subscriptions to individual connections, creating a low-latency fanout that minimizes compute and bandwidth requirements.\\n\\nDevices interface with our GraphQLDomain Graph Service (DGS). These schemas offer multiple query interfaces for prefetching, allowing devices to tailor their requests to the specific experience being presented. Each response adheres to a consistent API that resolves to a map of stage keys, enabling fast lookups and keeping business logic off the device. Our broadcast schema specifies WebSocket connection parameters, the current event stage, and the timestamp of the last broadcast message. When a device receives a broadcast, it injects the payload directly into its cache, triggering an immediate update and re-render of the interface.\\n\\n## Balancing the Moment: Throughput Management\\n\\nIn addition to building the new technology to support real-time recommendations, we also evaluated our existing systems for potential traffic hotspots. Using high-watermark traffic projections for live events, we generated synthetic traffic to simulate game-day scenarios and observed how our online services handled these bursts. Through this process, several common patterns emerged:\\n\\nBreaking the Cache Synchrony\\n\\nOur game-day simulations revealed that while our approach mitigated the immediate thundering herd risks driven by member traffic during the events, live events introduced unexpected mini thundering herds in our systems hours before and after the actual events. The surge of members joining just in time for these events led to concentrated cache expirations and recomputations, which created traffic spikes well outside the event window that we did not anticipate. This was not a problem for VOD content because the member traffic patterns are a lot smoother. We found that fixed TTLs caused cache expirations and refresh-traffic spikes to happen all at once. To address this, we added jitter to server and client cache expirations to spread out refreshes and smooth out traffic spikes.\\n\\nAdaptive Traffic Prioritization\\n\\nWhile our services already leverage traffic prioritization and partitioning based on factors such as request type and device type, live events introduced a distinct challenge. These events generated brief traffic bursts that were intensely spiky and placed significant strain on our systems. Through simulations, we recognized the need for an additional event-driven layer of traffic management.\\n\\nTo tackle this, we improved our traffic sharding strategies by using event-based signals. This enabled us to route live event traffic to dedicated clusters with more aggressive scaling policies. We also added a dynamic traffic prioritization ruleset that activates whenever we see high requests per second (RPS) to ensure our systems can handle the surge smoothly. During these peaks, we aggressively deprioritize non-critical server-driven updates so that our systems can devote resources to the most time-sensitive computations. This approach ensures smooth performance and reliability when demand is at its highest.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nWhen we set out to build a seamlessly scalable scheduled viewing experience, our goal was to create a dynamic and richer member experience for live content. Popular live events like the Crawford v. Canelo fight and the NFL Christmas games truly put our systems to the test. Along the way, we also uncovered valuable learnings that continue to shape our work. Our attempts to deprioritize traffic to other non-critical services caused unexpected call patterns and spikes in traffic elsewhere. Similarly, in hindsight, we also learned that the high traffic volume from popular events caused excessive non-essential logging and was putting unnecessary pressure on our ingestion pipelines.\\n\\nNone of this work would have been possible without our stunning colleagues at Netflix who collaborated across multiple functions to architect, build, and test these approaches, ensuring members can easily access events at the right moment: UI Engineering, Cloud Gateway, Data Science & Engineering, Search and Discovery, Evidence Engineering, Member Experience Foundations, Content Promotion and Distribution, Operations and Reliability, Device Playback, Experience and Design and Product Management.\\n\\nAs Netflix’s content offering expands to include new formats like live titles, free-to-air linear content, and games, we’re excited to build on what we’ve accomplished and look ahead to even more possibilities. Our roadmap includes extending the capabilities we developed for scheduled live viewing to these emerging formats. We’re also focused on enhancing our engineering tooling for greater visibility into operations, message delivery, and error handling to help us continue to deliver the best possible experience for our members.\\n\\n## Join Us for What’s Next\\n\\nWe’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible as we bring new live experiences to members around the world.

Generative recommenders (GRs) represent a new paradigm in the field of recommendation systems (e.g.HSTU,OneRec). These models draw inspiration from recent advancements in transformer architectures used for language and vision tasks. They approach the recommendation problem, including both ranking and retrieval, as a sequential transduction task. This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens. The reward model uses an open-sourced HSTU architecture in the convenience of reproducing this study. We adopt the standard RLHF approach of training a reward model using offline, human-collected feedback. We start by creating a proxy reward, scored on a scale from 1 to 5 in the convenience of understanding. This reward model is co-trained as a shallow reward head on top of the generative recommender. It predicts the reward for the most recently selected title based on a user’s interaction history. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare the model’s performance against two simple baselines: (1) predicting the next reward as the average reward the user has given in their past interactions, and (2) predicting it as the average reward that all users have assigned to that particular title in previous interactions.\\n\\nTable 1: Reward model performance metrics\\n\\nWe observe that the model’s predictions do not significantly outperform the simple baselines. This result is intuitive, as a user’s historical interactions typically cover only a small subset of titles, making it difficult to accurately predict their responses to the vast number of unexplored titles in the catalogue. We expect this to be a potential issue for any large recommendation systems where the ratio between explored and unexplored titles is very small.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\n3. Lack of Logged Policy\\n\\nIn recommendation systems, the policy that generated the logged data is typically unknown and cannot be directly estimated. Offline reinforcement learning methods often rely on Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to debias such data by reweighting interactions according to the logging policy’s action probabilities. However, estimating the logging policy accurately is challenging and prone to error, which can introduce additional biases, and IPS itself is known to suffer from high variance. Consequently, offline RL approaches that depend on IPS are ill-suited for our setting.\\n\\n## Advantage Weighted Supervised Fine Tuning\\n\\nGiven the three challenges outlined above, we propose a new algorithm Advantage-Weighted SFT (A-SFT). It leverages a combination of supervised fine-tuning and advantage reweighting from reinforcement learning. The key observation is as follows. Despite the reward estimation for each individual event having a high uncertainty, we find the estimations of rewards contain directional signals between high-reward and low-reward events. These signals could help better align the model during post-training.\\n\\nA central factor in this study is the generalization ability of the reward model. Better generalization enables more accurate predictions of user preferences for unseen titles, thereby making exploration more effective. For reward models with moderate to high generalization power, both online RL methods such as PPO and offline RL methods such as CQL can perform effectively. However, in our setting, reward model generalization is worse than the language counterparts’, which makes these algorithms less appropriate. In addition, the use of techniques like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) introduces a heightened risk of high-variance estimates, prompting us to exclude algorithms such as off-policy REINFORCE.\\n\\nOur proposed method A-SFT does not rely on IPS. With no need of prior knowledge of the logging policy, it can be generally applied to cases where observation of the environments are limited or biased. This is particularly useful to the recommendation setting due to the user feedback loop and distribution shifts with time. Without knowing the logging policy, A-SFT still provides means to control the policy deviation between the current policy and logging policy by tuning the parameter. This design provides essential means to control the learnt bias from uncertain reward models. We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1. Rejection Sampling Direct Preference Optimization / Identity Preference Optimization (RS DPO/IPO): this is a variant of DPO/IPO where, for each user history x, \\u200bwe generate contrasting response pairs by training an ensemble of reward models to estimate confidence intervals for the reward of multiple potential responses y. If the lower bound of the reward confidence interval for one response\\u200b is less than the upper bound for another response, then this pair is used to train DPO/IPO.\\n1. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL): This is a standard offline algorithm that learns a conservative Q function, penalizing overestimation of Q-values, particularly in regions of the state-action space with little or no reward data.\\n1. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): This is a standard RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) algorithm that uses reward models as an online environment. PPO learns an advantage function and optimizes the policy to maximize expected reward while maintaining proximity to the initial policy.\\n\\nWe sampled a separate test set of O(Millions) users. This test set is collected on a future date after the training.\\n\\n## Offline Evaluation Results\\n\\nWe evaluate our algorithm on a dataset of high-reward user trajectories. For sake of simplicity, we consider a trajectory to have a high reward if the accumulated reward is higher than the median of the population. We present the following metrics for the held out test dataset:\\n\\n1. NDCG@k: This measures the ranking quality of the recommended items up to position k. It accounts for the position of relevant items in the recommendation list, assigning higher scores when relevant items appear higher in the ranking. The gain is discounted logarithmically at lower ranks, and the result is normalized by the ideal ranking (i.e., the best possible ordering of items).\\n1. HR@k: This measures the proportion of test cases in which the ground-truth chosen item y appears in the top k recommendations. It is a binary metric per test case (hit or miss) and is averaged over all test cases.\\n1. MRR: MRR evaluates the ranking quality by measuring the reciprocal of the rank at which the chosen item appears in the recommendation list. The metric is averaged across all test cases.\\n1. Reward Model as A Judge: We use the reward model to evaluate the policy for future user events. We propose to use an ensemble of reward models for the evaluation to increase confidence. The result is based on the discounted reward generated for a few steps. The standard deviation is less than 4%.\\n\\nWe measure the percentage improvement in each metric compared to the baseline, Reward Weighted Behavior Cloning(BC). We notice that advantage weighted SFT shows the largest improvement in metrics, outweighing BC as well as reward model dependent algorithms like CQL, PPO, DPO and IPO.\\n\\nOur experiments show that advantage weighted SFT is a simple but promising approach for post-training generative recommenders as it deals with the issue of poor reward model generalizations and lack of IPS. More specifically, we find PPO, IPO and DPO achieve a good reward score, but also causes the overfitting from the reward model. Conservative Q-Learning achieves more robust improvements but does not fully capture the potential signals in the reward modeling.

Generative recommenders (GRs) represent a new paradigm in the field of recommendation systems (e.g.HSTU,OneRec). These models draw inspiration from recent advancements in transformer architectures used for language and vision tasks. They approach the recommendation problem, including both ranking and retrieval, as a sequential transduction task. This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens.

Check outpart 1andpart 2to learn more.\\n\\nPicture this: It’s seconds before the biggest fight night in Netflix history. Sixty-five million fans are waiting, devices in hand, hearts pounding. The countdown hits zero. What does it take to get everyone to the action on time, every time? At Netflix, we’re used to on-demand viewing where everyone chooses their own moment. But with live events, millions are eager to join in at once. Our job: make sure our members never miss a beat.\\n\\nWhen Live events break streaming records¹²³, our infrastructure faces the ultimate stress test. Here’s how we engineered a discovery experience for a global audience excited to see a knockout.\\n\\n## Why are Live Events Different?\\n\\nUnlike Video on Demand (VOD), members want to catch live events as they happen. There’s something uniquely exciting about being part of the moment. That means we only have a brief window to recommend a Live event at just the right time. Too early, excitement fades; too late, the moment is missed. Every second counts.\\n\\nTo capture that excitement, we enhanced our recommendation delivery systems to serve real-time suggestions, providing members richer and more compelling signals to hit play in the moment when it matters most. The challenge? Sending dynamic, timely updates concurrently to over a hundred million devices worldwide without creating athundering herd effectthat would overwhelm our cloud services. Simply scaling up linearly isn’t efficient and reliable. For popular events, it could also divert resources from other critical services. We needed a smarter and more scalable solution than just adding more resources.\\n\\n## Orchestrating the moment: Real-time Recommendations\\n\\nWith millions of devices online and live event schedules that can shift in real time, the challenge was to keep everyone perfectly in sync. We set out to solve this by building a system that doesn’t just react, but adapts by dynamically updating recommendations as the event unfolds. We identified the need to balance three constraints:\\n\\n* Time: the duration required to coordinate an update.\\n* Request throughput:the capacity of our cloud services to handle requests.\\n* Compute cardinality: the variety of requests necessary to serve a unique update.\\n\\nWe solved this constraint optimization problem by splitting the real-time recommendations into two phases:prefetchingandreal-time broadcasting. First, we prefetch the necessary data ahead of time, distributing the load over a longer period to avoid traffic spikes. When the Live event starts or ends, we broadcast a low cardinality message to all connected devices, prompting them to use the prefetched data locally. The timing of the broadcast also adapts when event times shift to preserve accuracy with the production of the Live event. By combining these two phases, we’re able to keep our members’ devices in sync and solve the thundering herd problem. To maximize device reach, especially for those with unstable networks, we use “at least once” broadcasts to ensure every device gets the latest updates and can catch up on any previously missed broadcasts as soon as they’re back online.\\n\\nThe first phase optimizesrequest throughputandcompute cardinalityby prefetching materialized recommendations, displayed title metadata, and artwork for a Live event. As members naturally browse their devices before the event, this data is prepopulated and stored locally in device cache, awaiting the notification trigger to serve the recommendations instantaneously. By distributing these requests naturally over time ahead of the event, we can eliminate any related traffic spikes and avoid the need for large-scale, real-time system scaling.\\n\\nThe second phase optimizesrequest throughputandtimeto updatedevices by broadcasting a low-cardinality, real-time message to all connected devices at critical moments in a Live event’s lifecycle. Each broadcast payload includes astate keyand atimestamp. The state key indicates the current stage of the Live event, allowing devices to use their pre-fetched data to update cached responses locally without additional server requests. The timestamp ensures that if a device misses a broadcast due to network issues, it can catch up by replaying missed updates upon reconnecting. This mechanism guarantees devices receive updates at least once, significantly increasing delivery reliability even on unstable networks.\\n\\n> Moment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\nMoment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\n## Under the Hood: How It Works\\n\\nWith the big picture in mind, let’s examine how these pieces interact in practice.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\nIn the diagram below, the Message Producer microservice centralizes all of the business logic. It continuously monitors live events for setup and timing changes. When it detects an update, it schedules broadcasts to be sent at precisely the right moment. The Message Producer also standardizes communication by providing a concise GraphQL schema for both device queries and broadcast payloads.\\n\\nRather than sending broadcasts directly to devices via WebSocket, the Message Producer hands them off to the Message Router. The Message Router is part of a robust two-tier pub/sub architecture built on proven technologies likePushy(our WebSocket proxy), Apache Kafka, andNetflix’s KV key-value store. The Message Router tracks subscriptions at the Pushy node granularity, while Pushy nodes map the subscriptions to individual connections, creating a low-latency fanout that minimizes compute and bandwidth requirements.\\n\\nDevices interface with our GraphQLDomain Graph Service (DGS). These schemas offer multiple query interfaces for prefetching, allowing devices to tailor their requests to the specific experience being presented. Each response adheres to a consistent API that resolves to a map of stage keys, enabling fast lookups and keeping business logic off the device. Our broadcast schema specifies WebSocket connection parameters, the current event stage, and the timestamp of the last broadcast message. When a device receives a broadcast, it injects the payload directly into its cache, triggering an immediate update and re-render of the interface.\\n\\n## Balancing the Moment: Throughput Management\\n\\nIn addition to building the new technology to support real-time recommendations, we also evaluated our existing systems for potential traffic hotspots. Using high-watermark traffic projections for live events, we generated synthetic traffic to simulate game-day scenarios and observed how our online services handled these bursts. Through this process, several common patterns emerged:\\n\\nBreaking the Cache Synchrony\\n\\nOur game-day simulations revealed that while our approach mitigated the immediate thundering herd risks driven by member traffic during the events, live events introduced unexpected mini thundering herds in our systems hours before and after the actual events. The surge of members joining just in time for these events led to concentrated cache expirations and recomputations, which created traffic spikes well outside the event window that we did not anticipate. This was not a problem for VOD content because the member traffic patterns are a lot smoother. We found that fixed TTLs caused cache expirations and refresh-traffic spikes to happen all at once. To address this, we added jitter to server and client cache expirations to spread out refreshes and smooth out traffic spikes.\\n\\nAdaptive Traffic Prioritization\\n\\nWhile our services already leverage traffic prioritization and partitioning based on factors such as request type and device type, live events introduced a distinct challenge. These events generated brief traffic bursts that were intensely spiky and placed significant strain on our systems. Through simulations, we recognized the need for an additional event-driven layer of traffic management.\\n\\nTo tackle this, we improved our traffic sharding strategies by using event-based signals. This enabled us to route live event traffic to dedicated clusters with more aggressive scaling policies. We also added a dynamic traffic prioritization ruleset that activates whenever we see high requests per second (RPS) to ensure our systems can handle the surge smoothly. During these peaks, we aggressively deprioritize non-critical server-driven updates so that our systems can devote resources to the most time-sensitive computations. This approach ensures smooth performance and reliability when demand is at its highest.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nWhen we set out to build a seamlessly scalable scheduled viewing experience, our goal was to create a dynamic and richer member experience for live content. Popular live events like the Crawford v. Canelo fight and the NFL Christmas games truly put our systems to the test. Along the way, we also uncovered valuable learnings that continue to shape our work. Our attempts to deprioritize traffic to other non-critical services caused unexpected call patterns and spikes in traffic elsewhere. Similarly, in hindsight, we also learned that the high traffic volume from popular events caused excessive non-essential logging and was putting unnecessary pressure on our ingestion pipelines.\\n\\nNone of this work would have been possible without our stunning colleagues at Netflix who collaborated across multiple functions to architect, build, and test these approaches, ensuring members can easily access events at the right moment: UI Engineering, Cloud Gateway, Data Science & Engineering, Search and Discovery, Evidence Engineering, Member Experience Foundations, Content Promotion and Distribution, Operations and Reliability, Device Playback, Experience and Design and Product Management.\\n\\nAs Netflix’s content offering expands to include new formats like live titles, free-to-air linear content, and games, we’re excited to build on what we’ve accomplished and look ahead to even more possibilities. Our roadmap includes extending the capabilities we developed for scheduled live viewing to these emerging formats. We’re also focused on enhancing our engineering tooling for greater visibility into operations, message delivery, and error handling to help us continue to deliver the best possible experience for our members.\\n\\n## Join Us for What’s Next\\n\\nWe’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible as we bring new live experiences to members around the world.

Generative recommenders (GRs) represent a new paradigm in the field of recommendation systems (e.g.HSTU,OneRec). These models draw inspiration from recent advancements in transformer architectures used for language and vision tasks. They approach the recommendation problem, including both ranking and retrieval, as a sequential transduction task. This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens. The reward model uses an open-sourced HSTU architecture in the convenience of reproducing this study. We adopt the standard RLHF approach of training a reward model using offline, human-collected feedback. We start by creating a proxy reward, scored on a scale from 1 to 5 in the convenience of understanding. This reward model is co-trained as a shallow reward head on top of the generative recommender. It predicts the reward for the most recently selected title based on a user’s interaction history. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare the model’s performance against two simple baselines: (1) predicting the next reward as the average reward the user has given in their past interactions, and (2) predicting it as the average reward that all users have assigned to that particular title in previous interactions.\\n\\nTable 1: Reward model performance metrics\\n\\nWe observe that the model’s predictions do not significantly outperform the simple baselines. This result is intuitive, as a user’s historical interactions typically cover only a small subset of titles, making it difficult to accurately predict their responses to the vast number of unexplored titles in the catalogue. We expect this to be a potential issue for any large recommendation systems where the ratio between explored and unexplored titles is very small.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\n3. Lack of Logged Policy\\n\\nIn recommendation systems, the policy that generated the logged data is typically unknown and cannot be directly estimated. Offline reinforcement learning methods often rely on Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to debias such data by reweighting interactions according to the logging policy’s action probabilities. However, estimating the logging policy accurately is challenging and prone to error, which can introduce additional biases, and IPS itself is known to suffer from high variance. Consequently, offline RL approaches that depend on IPS are ill-suited for our setting.\\n\\n## Advantage Weighted Supervised Fine Tuning\\n\\nGiven the three challenges outlined above, we propose a new algorithm Advantage-Weighted SFT (A-SFT). It leverages a combination of supervised fine-tuning and advantage reweighting from reinforcement learning. The key observation is as follows. Despite the reward estimation for each individual event having a high uncertainty, we find the estimations of rewards contain directional signals between high-reward and low-reward events. These signals could help better align the model during post-training.\\n\\nA central factor in this study is the generalization ability of the reward model. Better generalization enables more accurate predictions of user preferences for unseen titles, thereby making exploration more effective. For reward models with moderate to high generalization power, both online RL methods such as PPO and offline RL methods such as CQL can perform effectively. However, in our setting, reward model generalization is worse than the language counterparts’, which makes these algorithms less appropriate. In addition, the use of techniques like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) introduces a heightened risk of high-variance estimates, prompting us to exclude algorithms such as off-policy REINFORCE.\\n\\nOur proposed method A-SFT does not rely on IPS. With no need of prior knowledge of the logging policy, it can be generally applied to cases where observation of the environments are limited or biased. This is particularly useful to the recommendation setting due to the user feedback loop and distribution shifts with time. Without knowing the logging policy, A-SFT still provides means to control the policy deviation between the current policy and logging policy by tuning the parameter. This design provides essential means to control the learnt bias from uncertain reward models. We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1. Rejection Sampling Direct Preference Optimization / Identity Preference Optimization (RS DPO/IPO): this is a variant of DPO/IPO where, for each user history x, \\u200bwe generate contrasting response pairs by training an ensemble of reward models to estimate confidence intervals for the reward of multiple potential responses y. If the lower bound of the reward confidence interval for one response\\u200b is less than the upper bound for another response, then this pair is used to train DPO/IPO.\\n1. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL): This is a standard offline algorithm that learns a conservative Q function, penalizing overestimation of Q-values, particularly in regions of the state-action space with little or no reward data.\\n1. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): This is a standard RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) algorithm that uses reward models as an online environment. PPO learns an advantage function and optimizes the policy to maximize expected reward while maintaining proximity to the initial policy.\\n\\nWe sampled a separate test set of O(Millions) users. This test set is collected on a future date after the training.\\n\\n## Offline Evaluation Results\\n\\nWe evaluate our algorithm on a dataset of high-reward user trajectories. For sake of simplicity, we consider a trajectory to have a high reward if the accumulated reward is higher than the median of the population. We present the following metrics for the held out test dataset:\\n\\n1. NDCG@k: This measures the ranking quality of the recommended items up to position k. It accounts for the position of relevant items in the recommendation list, assigning higher scores when relevant items appear higher in the ranking. The gain is discounted logarithmically at lower ranks, and the result is normalized by the ideal ranking (i.e., the best possible ordering of items).\\n1. HR@k: This measures the proportion of test cases in which the ground-truth chosen item y appears in the top k recommendations. It is a binary metric per test case (hit or miss) and is averaged over all test cases.\\n1. MRR: MRR evaluates the ranking quality by measuring the reciprocal of the rank at which the chosen item appears in the recommendation list. The metric is averaged across all test cases.\\n1. Reward Model as A Judge: We use the reward model to evaluate the policy for future user events. We propose to use an ensemble of reward models for the evaluation to increase confidence. The result is based on the discounted reward generated for a few steps. The standard deviation is less than 4%.\\n\\nWe measure the percentage improvement in each metric compared to the baseline, Reward Weighted Behavior Cloning(BC). We notice that advantage weighted SFT shows the largest improvement in metrics, outweighing BC as well as reward model dependent algorithms like CQL, PPO, DPO and IPO.\\n\\nOur experiments show that advantage weighted SFT is a simple but promising approach for post-training generative recommenders as it deals with the issue of poor reward model generalizations and lack of IPS. More specifically, we find PPO, IPO and DPO achieve a good reward score, but also causes the overfitting from the reward model. Conservative Q-Learning achieves more robust improvements but does not fully capture the potential signals in the reward modeling. A-SFT achieved both better recommendation metrics and reward scores.', 'title': 'Post-Training Generative Recommenders with Advantage-Weighted Supervised Finetuning', 'url': 'https://netflixtechblog.com/post-training-generative-recommenders-with-advantage-weighted-supervised-finetuning-61a538d717a9?source=collection_home_page----2615bd06b42e-----0-----------------------------------'}, {'markdown': 'Author:Keertana Chidambaram,Qiuling Xu,Ko-Jen Hsiao,Moumita Bhattacharya\\n\\n(*The work was done when Keertana interned at Netflix.)\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThis blog focuses on post-training generative recommender systems.

This perspective enables generative training, where the model learns by imitating the next event in a sequence of user activities, thereby effectively modeling user behavior over time.\\n\\nHowever, a key challenge with simply replicating observed user patterns is that it may not always lead to the best possible recommendations. User interactions are influenced by a variety of factors — such as trends, or external suggestions — and the system’s view of these interactions is inherently limited. For example, if a user tries a popular show but later indicates it wasn’t a good fit, a model that only imitates this behavior might continue to recommend similar content, missing the chance to enhance the user’s experience.\\n\\nThis highlights the importance of incorporating user preferences and feedback, rather than solely relying on observed behavior, to improve recommendation quality. In the context of recommendation systems, we benefit from a wealth of user feedback, which includes explicit signals such as ratings and reviews, as well as implicit signals like watch time, click-through rates, and overall engagement. This abundance of feedback serves as a valuable resource for improving model performance.\\n\\nGiven the recent success of reinforcement learning techniques in post-training large language models, such as DPO and GRPO, this study investigates whether similar methods can be applied to generative recommenders. Ultimately, our goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges in using these techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of recommendations.\\n\\nUnlike language models, post-training generative recommenders presents unique challenges. One of the most significant is the difficulty of obtaining counterfactual feedback in recommendation scenarios. The recommendation feedback is generated on-policy — that is, it reflects users’ real-time interactions with the system as they naturally use it. Since a typical user sequence can span weeks or even years of activity, it is impractical to ask users to review or provide feedback on hypothetical, counterfactual experiences. As a result, the absence of counterfactual data makes it challenging to apply post-training methods such as PPO or DPO, which require feedback from counterfactual user sequences.\\n\\nFurthermore, post-training methods typically rely on a reward model — either implicit or explicit — to guide optimization. The quality of reward models heavily influences the effectiveness of post-training. In the context of recommendation systems, however, reward signals tend to be much noisier. For instance, if we use watch time as an implicit reward, it may not always accurately reflect user satisfaction: a viewer might stop watching a favorite show simply due to time constraints, while finishing a lengthy show doesn’t necessarily indicate genuine enjoyment.\\n\\nTo address these post-training challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm called Advantage-Weighted Supervised Fine-tuning (A-SFT). Our analysis first demonstrates that reward models in recommendation systems often exhibit higher uncertainty due to the issues discussed above. Rather than relying solely on these uncertain reward models, A-SFT combines supervised fine-tuning with the advantage function to more effectively guide post-training optimization. This approach proves especially effective when the reward model has high variance but still provides valuable directional signals. We benchmark A-SFT against four other representative methods, and our results show that A-SFT achieves better alignment between the pre-trained generative recommendation model and the reward model.\\n\\nIn Figure 1, we conceptualize the pros and cons of different post-training paradigms. For example, Online Reinforcement Learning is most useful when the reward model has a good generalization ability, and behavior cloning is suitable when no reward models are available. Using these algorithms under fitting use cases is the key to a successful post-training. For example, over-exploitation of noisy reward models will hurt task performance, as guidance from the reward models can be simply noise. Conversely, not leveraging a good reward model leaves out potential improvements. We find A-SFT fits the sweet point between offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning, where it benefits from the directional signals in those noisy estimations and is less dependent on the reward accuracy.\\n\\nFigure 1: The landscape of RL algorithms based on the reward models’ accuracy\\n\\n## Challenges in Post-training for Recommendation\\n\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most popular framework for post-training large language models. In this framework, human annotators evaluate and rank different outputs generated by a model. This feedback is then used to train a reward model that predicts how well a model output aligns with human preferences. This reward model then serves as a proxy for human judgment during reinforcement learning, guiding the model to generate outputs that are more likely to be preferred by humans.\\n\\nWhile traditional RLHF methods like PPO or DPO are effective for aligning LLMs, there are several challenges in applying them directly to large-scale recommendation systems:\\n\\n1. Lack of Counter-factual Observations\\n\\nAs in typical RLHF settings, collecting real-time feedback from a diverse user base across a wide range of items is both costly and impractical. The data in recommendation are generated by the real-time user interests. Any third-party annotators or even the user themselves lack the practical means to evaluate an alternative reality. For example, it is impractical to ask the Netflix users to evaluate hundreds of unseen movies. Consequently, we lack a live environment in which to perform reinforcement learning.\\n\\n2. Noisy Reward Models\\n\\nIn addition to the limited counter-factual data, the recommendation task itself has a higher randomness by its nature. The recommendation data has less structure than language data. Users choose to watch some shows not because there is a grammar rule that nouns need to follow by the verbs. In fact, the users’ choices usually exhibit a level of permutation invariance, where swapping the order of events in the user history still makes a valid activity sequence. This randomness in the behaviors makes learning a good reward model extremely difficult. Often the reward models we learnt still have a large margin of errors.\\n\\nHere is an ablation study we did on the reward model performance with O(Millions) users and O(Billions) of tokens. The reward model uses an open-sourced HSTU architecture in the convenience of reproducing this study. We adopt the standard RLHF approach of training a reward model using offline, human-collected feedback. We start by creating a proxy reward, scored on a scale from 1 to 5 in the convenience of understanding. This reward model is co-trained as a shallow reward head on top of the generative recommender. It predicts the reward for the most recently selected title based on a user’s interaction history. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare the model’s performance against two simple baselines: (1) predicting the next reward as the average reward the user has given in their past interactions, and (2) predicting it as the average reward that all users have assigned to that particular title in previous interactions.\\n\\nTable 1: Reward model performance metrics\\n\\nWe observe that the model’s predictions do not significantly outperform the simple baselines. This result is intuitive, as a user’s historical interactions typically cover only a small subset of titles, making it difficult to accurately predict their responses to the vast number of unexplored titles in the catalogue. We expect this to be a potential issue for any large recommendation systems where the ratio between explored and unexplored titles is very small.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\n3. Lack of Logged Policy\\n\\nIn recommendation systems, the policy that generated the logged data is typically unknown and cannot be directly estimated. Offline reinforcement learning methods often rely on Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to debias such data by reweighting interactions according to the logging policy’s action probabilities. However, estimating the logging policy accurately is challenging and prone to error, which can introduce additional biases, and IPS itself is known to suffer from high variance. Consequently, offline RL approaches that depend on IPS are ill-suited for our setting.\\n\\n## Advantage Weighted Supervised Fine Tuning\\n\\nGiven the three challenges outlined above, we propose a new algorithm Advantage-Weighted SFT (A-SFT). It leverages a combination of supervised fine-tuning and advantage reweighting from reinforcement learning. The key observation is as follows. Despite the reward estimation for each individual event having a high uncertainty, we find the estimations of rewards contain directional signals between high-reward and low-reward events. These signals could help better align the model during post-training.\\n\\nA central factor in this study is the generalization ability of the reward model. Better generalization enables more accurate predictions of user preferences for unseen titles, thereby making exploration more effective. For reward models with moderate to high generalization power, both online RL methods such as PPO and offline RL methods such as CQL can perform effectively. However, in our setting, reward model generalization is worse than the language counterparts’, which makes these algorithms less appropriate. In addition, the use of techniques like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) introduces a heightened risk of high-variance estimates, prompting us to exclude algorithms such as off-policy REINFORCE.\\n\\nOur proposed method A-SFT does not rely on IPS. With no need of prior knowledge of the logging policy, it can be generally applied to cases where observation of the environments are limited or biased. This is particularly useful to the recommendation setting due to the user feedback loop and distribution shifts with time. Without knowing the logging policy, A-SFT still provides means to control the policy deviation between the current policy and logging policy by tuning the parameter. This design provides essential means to control the learnt bias from uncertain reward models. We show that A-SFT outperforms baseline behavior cloning by directly optimizing observed rewards.\\n\\nThe advantage-weighted SFT algorithm is as follows:\\n\\nFor the results presented in this blog post, we treat the recommendation problem as a contextual bandit, i.e. given a history of user interactions as the context, can we recommend a high reward next title recommendation for the user?\\n\\n## Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compared representative algorithms including PPO, IPO, DPO, CQL and SFT as the baselines:\\n\\n1. Reward weighted Behavior Cloning: This benchmark algorithm modifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by weighting the loss with the raw rewards of the chosen item instead of weighing the loss with advantage as in the proposed algorithm.\\n1. Rejection Sampling Direct Preference Optimization / Identity Preference Optimization (RS DPO/IPO): this is a variant of DPO/IPO where, for each user history x, \\u200bwe generate contrasting response pairs by training an ensemble of reward models to estimate confidence intervals for the reward of multiple potential responses y. If the lower bound of the reward confidence interval for one response\\u200b is less than the upper bound for another response, then this pair is used to train DPO/IPO.\\n1. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL): This is a standard offline algorithm that learns a conservative Q function, penalizing overestimation of Q-values, particularly in regions of the state-action space with little or no reward data.\\n1. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): This is a standard RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) algorithm that uses reward models as an online environment. PPO learns an advantage function and optimizes the policy to maximize expected reward while maintaining proximity to the initial policy.\\n\\nWe sampled a separate test set of O(Millions) users. This test set is collected on a future date after the training.\\n\\n## Offline Evaluation Results\\n\\nWe evaluate our algorithm on a dataset of high-reward user trajectories. For sake of simplicity, we consider a trajectory to have a high reward if the accumulated reward is higher than the median of the population. We present the following metrics for the held out test dataset:\\n\\n1. NDCG@k: This measures the ranking quality of the recommended items up to position k. It accounts for the position of relevant items in the recommendation list, assigning higher scores when relevant items appear higher in the ranking. The gain is discounted logarithmically at lower ranks, and the result is normalized by the ideal ranking (i.e., the best possible ordering of items).\\n1. HR@k: This measures the proportion of test cases in which the ground-truth chosen item y appears in the top k recommendations. It is a binary metric per test case (hit or miss) and is averaged over all test cases.\\n1. MRR: MRR evaluates the ranking quality by measuring the reciprocal of the rank at which the chosen item appears in the recommendation list. The metric is averaged across all test cases.\\n1. Reward Model as A Judge: We use the reward model to evaluate the policy for future user events. We propose to use an ensemble of reward models for the evaluation to increase confidence. The result is based on the discounted reward generated for a few steps. The standard deviation is less than 4%.\\n\\nWe measure the percentage improvement in each metric compared to the baseline, Reward Weighted Behavior Cloning(BC). We notice that advantage weighted SFT shows the largest improvement in metrics, outweighing BC as well as reward model dependent algorithms like CQL, PPO, DPO and IPO.\\n\\nOur experiments show that advantage weighted SFT is a simple but promising approach for post-training generative recommenders as it deals with the issue of poor reward model generalizations and lack of IPS. More specifically, we find PPO, IPO and DPO achieve a good reward score, but also causes the overfitting from the reward model. Conservative Q-Learning achieves more robust improvements but does not fully capture the potential signals in the reward modeling.

Check outpart 1andpart 2to learn more.\\n\\nPicture this: It’s seconds before the biggest fight night in Netflix history. Sixty-five million fans are waiting, devices in hand, hearts pounding. The countdown hits zero. What does it take to get everyone to the action on time, every time? At Netflix, we’re used to on-demand viewing where everyone chooses their own moment. But with live events, millions are eager to join in at once. Our job: make sure our members never miss a beat.\\n\\nWhen Live events break streaming records¹²³, our infrastructure faces the ultimate stress test. Here’s how we engineered a discovery experience for a global audience excited to see a knockout.\\n\\n## Why are Live Events Different?\\n\\nUnlike Video on Demand (VOD), members want to catch live events as they happen. There’s something uniquely exciting about being part of the moment. That means we only have a brief window to recommend a Live event at just the right time. Too early, excitement fades; too late, the moment is missed. Every second counts.\\n\\nTo capture that excitement, we enhanced our recommendation delivery systems to serve real-time suggestions, providing members richer and more compelling signals to hit play in the moment when it matters most. The challenge? Sending dynamic, timely updates concurrently to over a hundred million devices worldwide without creating athundering herd effectthat would overwhelm our cloud services. Simply scaling up linearly isn’t efficient and reliable. For popular events, it could also divert resources from other critical services. We needed a smarter and more scalable solution than just adding more resources.\\n\\n## Orchestrating the moment: Real-time Recommendations\\n\\nWith millions of devices online and live event schedules that can shift in real time, the challenge was to keep everyone perfectly in sync. We set out to solve this by building a system that doesn’t just react, but adapts by dynamically updating recommendations as the event unfolds. We identified the need to balance three constraints:\\n\\n* Time: the duration required to coordinate an update.\\n* Request throughput:the capacity of our cloud services to handle requests.\\n* Compute cardinality: the variety of requests necessary to serve a unique update.\\n\\nWe solved this constraint optimization problem by splitting the real-time recommendations into two phases:prefetchingandreal-time broadcasting. First, we prefetch the necessary data ahead of time, distributing the load over a longer period to avoid traffic spikes. When the Live event starts or ends, we broadcast a low cardinality message to all connected devices, prompting them to use the prefetched data locally. The timing of the broadcast also adapts when event times shift to preserve accuracy with the production of the Live event. By combining these two phases, we’re able to keep our members’ devices in sync and solve the thundering herd problem. To maximize device reach, especially for those with unstable networks, we use “at least once” broadcasts to ensure every device gets the latest updates and can catch up on any previously missed broadcasts as soon as they’re back online.\\n\\nThe first phase optimizesrequest throughputandcompute cardinalityby prefetching materialized recommendations, displayed title metadata, and artwork for a Live event. As members naturally browse their devices before the event, this data is prepopulated and stored locally in device cache, awaiting the notification trigger to serve the recommendations instantaneously. By distributing these requests naturally over time ahead of the event, we can eliminate any related traffic spikes and avoid the need for large-scale, real-time system scaling.\\n\\nThe second phase optimizesrequest throughputandtimeto updatedevices by broadcasting a low-cardinality, real-time message to all connected devices at critical moments in a Live event’s lifecycle. Each broadcast payload includes astate keyand atimestamp. The state key indicates the current stage of the Live event, allowing devices to use their pre-fetched data to update cached responses locally without additional server requests. The timestamp ensures that if a device misses a broadcast due to network issues, it can catch up by replaying missed updates upon reconnecting. This mechanism guarantees devices receive updates at least once, significantly increasing delivery reliability even on unstable networks.\\n\\n> Moment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\nMoment in Numbers: During peak load, we have successfully delivered updates at multiple stages of our events to over 100 million devices in under a minute.\\n\\n## Under the Hood: How It Works\\n\\nWith the big picture in mind, let’s examine how these pieces interact in practice.\\n\\n## Get Netflix Technology Blog’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\nIn the diagram below, the Message Producer microservice centralizes all of the business logic. It continuously monitors live events for setup and timing changes. When it detects an update, it schedules broadcasts to be sent at precisely the right moment. The Message Producer also standardizes communication by providing a concise GraphQL schema for both device queries and broadcast payloads.\\n\\nRather than sending broadcasts directly to devices via WebSocket, the Message Producer hands them off to the Message Router. The Message Router is part of a robust two-tier pub/sub architecture built on proven technologies likePushy(our WebSocket proxy), Apache Kafka, andNetflix’s KV key-value store. The Message Router tracks subscriptions at the Pushy node granularity, while Pushy nodes map the subscriptions to individual connections, creating a low-latency fanout that minimizes compute and bandwidth requirements.\\n\\nDevices interface with our GraphQLDomain Graph Service (DGS). These schemas offer multiple query interfaces for prefetching, allowing devices to tailor their requests to the specific experience being presented. Each response adheres to a consistent API that resolves to a map of stage keys, enabling fast lookups and keeping business logic off the device. Our broadcast schema specifies WebSocket connection parameters, the current event stage, and the timestamp of the last broadcast message. When a device receives a broadcast, it injects the payload directly into its cache, triggering an immediate update and re-render of the interface.\\n\\n## Balancing the Moment: Throughput Management\\n\\nIn addition to building the new technology to support real-time recommendations, we also evaluated our existing systems for potential traffic hotspots. Using high-watermark traffic projections for live events, we generated synthetic traffic to simulate game-day scenarios and observed how our online services handled these bursts. Through this process, several common patterns emerged:\\n\\nBreaking the Cache Synchrony\\n\\nOur game-day simulations revealed that while our approach mitigated the immediate thundering herd risks driven by member traffic during the events, live events introduced unexpected mini thundering herds in our systems hours before and after the actual events. The surge of members joining just in time for these events led to concentrated cache expirations and recomputations, which created traffic spikes well outside the event window that we did not anticipate. This was not a problem for VOD content because the member traffic patterns are a lot smoother. We found that fixed TTLs caused cache expirations and refresh-traffic spikes to happen all at once. To address this, we added jitter to server and client cache expirations to spread out refreshes and smooth out traffic spikes.\\n\\nAdaptive Traffic Prioritization\\n\\nWhile our services already leverage traffic prioritization and partitioning based on factors such as request type and device type, live events introduced a distinct challenge. These events generated brief traffic bursts that were intensely spiky and placed significant strain on our systems. Through simulations, we recognized the need for an additional event-driven layer of traffic management.\\n\\nTo tackle this, we improved our traffic sharding strategies by using event-based signals. This enabled us to route live event traffic to dedicated clusters with more aggressive scaling policies. We also added a dynamic traffic prioritization ruleset that activates whenever we see high requests per second (RPS) to ensure our systems can handle the surge smoothly. During these peaks, we aggressively deprioritize non-critical server-driven updates so that our systems can devote resources to the most time-sensitive computations. This approach ensures smooth performance and reliability when demand is at its highest.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nWhen we set out to build a seamlessly scalable scheduled viewing experience, our goal was to create a dynamic and richer member experience for live content. Popular live events like the Crawford v. Canelo fight and the NFL Christmas games truly put our systems to the test. Along the way, we also uncovered valuable learnings that continue to shape our work. Our attempts to deprioritize traffic to other non-critical services caused unexpected call patterns and spikes in traffic elsewhere. Similarly, in hindsight, we also learned that the high traffic volume from popular events caused excessive non-essential logging and was putting unnecessary pressure on our ingestion pipelines.\\n\\nNone of this work would have been possible without our stunning colleagues at Netflix who collaborated across multiple functions to architect, build, and test these approaches, ensuring members can easily access events at the right moment: UI Engineering, Cloud Gateway, Data Science & Engineering, Search and Discovery, Evidence Engineering, Member Experience Foundations, Content Promotion and Distribution, Operations and Reliability, Device Playback, Experience and Design and Product Management.\\n\\nAs Netflix’s content offering expands to include new formats like live titles, free-to-air linear content, and games, we’re excited to build on what we’ve accomplished and look ahead to even more possibilities. Our roadmap includes extending the capabilities we developed for scheduled live viewing to these emerging formats. We’re also focused on enhancing our engineering tooling for greater visibility into operations, message delivery, and error handling to help us continue to deliver the best possible experience for our members.\\n\\n## Join Us for What’s Next\\n\\nWe’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible as we bring new live experiences to members around the world.
